However, the bathroom door is missing its opening/gap, and the kitchen/living area wall proportions are slightly stretched compared to the 2D template. Window placement on the bottom-most wall is misaligned with the 2D plan."

However, the shading is not strictly 'flat'; there is significant soft-shadowing and ambient occlusion that leans toward a stylized 3D render rather than a strictly flat-shaded architectural diagram. Camera angle is correctly isometric."

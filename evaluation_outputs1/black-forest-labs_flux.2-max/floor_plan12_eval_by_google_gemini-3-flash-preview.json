Small text-like glyphs appear on some walls (e.g., above toilet and bed walls) violating the 'no text' constraint. Balcony railings are interpreted as high structural fences."

Points deducted for the presence of semi-transparent circular 'ghosting' frames where doors are located, which adds visual clutter not present in a clean render."

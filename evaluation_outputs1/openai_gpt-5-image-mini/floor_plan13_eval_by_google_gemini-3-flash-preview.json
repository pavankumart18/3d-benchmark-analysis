Bedroom 1 and Bedroom 2 have swapped relative positions or been significantly re-scaled. Door placements for the bathroom and WC are missing or closed in a way that obscures their plan-truth orientation. Window in the lounge is missing."

The garage is detached as requested but the main unit walls are Simplified to the point of losing room definition for the Laundry/Washing Machine area."

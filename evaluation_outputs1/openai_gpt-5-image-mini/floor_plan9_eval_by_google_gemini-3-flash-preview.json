The garage scale is completely incorrect (rendered as a small bedroom size), and the entire floor plan orientation feels mirrored or heavily reinterpreted. Specific room adjacencies from the blueprint, particularly around the kitchen and hallway, are lost. Window and door placements are generic rather than following the blueprint's specific coordinates."

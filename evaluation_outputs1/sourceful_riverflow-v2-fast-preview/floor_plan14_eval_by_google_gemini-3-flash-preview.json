        "notes": "Furniture placement captures almost all primary fixtures including beds, sofas, and the dining set. The kitchen counter layout is slightly simplified compared to the L-shape indicated in the plan, and the utility area fixtures are more generic than the specific washer/sink icons shown."

        "notes": "High adherence to the low-poly aesthetic. Flat shading and soft ambient lighting are applied correctly. The camera is isometric, though slightly closer to a top-down perspective than a true 45-degree angle, but still acceptable within the orthographic constraint."

However, window placements on the bottom wall differ from the plan (the plan shows three window segments, whereas the render shows variations in spacing). The balcony thickness is also slightly exaggerated compared to the plan."

However, the render severely fails the 'NO text labels' constraint by hallucinating 'Bedroom' and 'Kitchen/Living' text directly onto the 3D floor, appearing to copy the 2D plan's annotation layer into the 3D space."

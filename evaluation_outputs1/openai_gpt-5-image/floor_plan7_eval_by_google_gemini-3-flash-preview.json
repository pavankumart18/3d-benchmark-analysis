        "notes": "General room placement and adjacency are correct. However, doors and windows are missing or misplaced: the 3D model lacks the large windows in the Dining and Living rooms, and several interior doors (e.g., Bedroom 1 and Kitchen entry) are represented as open gaps rather than structured doorways. The staircase orientation is simplified compared to the U-turn layout in the plan."

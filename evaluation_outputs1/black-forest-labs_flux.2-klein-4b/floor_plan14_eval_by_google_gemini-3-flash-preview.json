The entrance foyer area is missing proper wall partitioning. Door placements are largely missing or replaced with open gaps.

Specifically, the toilet partitions and utility area walls are hallucinated or simplified improperly. No text/UI elements are present, which is a positive compliance."

The kitchen counter lacks the specific 'L-shape' shown in the original plan. The dining table is placed in the center of a wide-open hall that does not exist in the floor plan."

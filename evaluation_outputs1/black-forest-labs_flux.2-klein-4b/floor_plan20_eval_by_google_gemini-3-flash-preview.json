However, there is a significant wall misalignment in the Living/Deck area where the sliding door boundary has been simplified into a single wall, losing the indented deck footprint. Toilet-4 and Toilet-3 layouts are slightly merged/simplified. Door swings are missing in several interior transitions."

Penalty applied for the reinterpretation of the 'Deck' and 'Balcony' areas; the exterior boundaries are filled as interior space rather than maintaining the railing/open-air distinction."

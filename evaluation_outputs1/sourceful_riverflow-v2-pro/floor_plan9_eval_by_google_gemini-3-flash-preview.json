        "notes": "Strong adherence to floor plan geometry. Most room adjacencies and wall alignments are correct. Key deductions: Kitchen island angle is slightly simplified compared to the multi-angled 2D design. Door orientations largely match but some door swings in the bathroom area are indistinct."

Most doors are represented via wall gaps, though specific door swing orientations are naturally lost in the wall-cut style. Window placements on the exterior walls match the blueprint."

Points deducted for the balcony area (labeled 'CLOSET' in 2D) which has been reinterpreted with a railing style that doesn't fully match the enclosed closet intention, though it captures the spatial footprint."

Small deduction as the camera angle is a high-tilt perspective rather than a true 45-degree isometric orthographic view (slight perspective distortion visible toward the edges)."

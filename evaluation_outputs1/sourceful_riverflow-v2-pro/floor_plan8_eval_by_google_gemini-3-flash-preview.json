        "notes": "Excellent replication of the complex wall perimeters and bay windows. Door orientations generally match. Minor deduction for the scaling of the central pantry island which appears slightly wider than the blueprint, and the playroom window layout is simplified compared to the multi-pane blueprint spec."

The 'Playroom' uses blocks to represent toys which is a clever interpretation of the room's function, though the sofa placement in the living room is additive (not explicitly on the plan)."

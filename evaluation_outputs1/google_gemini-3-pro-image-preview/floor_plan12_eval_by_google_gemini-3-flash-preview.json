However, there are significant door placement errors: the entrance to the main bathroom is missing its door swing/opening in the 3D model, and the orientation of the Bed 2 door is mirrored. Window placement in the Activity area and Bed 4 is slightly shifted compared to the plan."

Roof is removed as requested and no text/labels are present. Minor deduction for the thickness of internal walls not matching the 2D plan's hierarchy (e.g., linen closet wall)."

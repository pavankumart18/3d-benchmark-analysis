Room placement does not correspond; walls and circulation are not aligned to the 2D layout. Door and window locations in the render do not match the plan\u2019s indicated openings (notably the dining room bay/window seat zone and kitchen-side openings). Strong proportion drift: the 3D render\u2019s room sizes and overall footprint do not preserve the plan\u2019s geometry."

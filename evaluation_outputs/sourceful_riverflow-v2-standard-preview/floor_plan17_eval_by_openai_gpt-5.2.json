The 2D plan has a large combined living/dining zone on the left with a wide balcony at the top-left; the 3D render shows a different central open area and does not clearly reproduce the living/dining footprint or its balcony connection (E2/E1). The right-side bedroom wing (Bed 2/Bed 3 with attached/common toilets) is not clearly arranged per the plan; room placements and corridor geometry do not align (E2). Door locations/orientations (foyer entry, bedroom doors, toilet doors) are largely not verifiable or appear inconsistent with the 2D plan (E2/E3). Window/balcony openings on exterior edges do not match the plan\u2019s balcony locations and window distribution (E2/E1). Overall proportions are distorted: several rooms appear oversized/undersized compared to the plan\u2019s labeled dimensions and adjacency spacing (E4)."

Adjacency relationships are inconsistent (e.g., master suite should connect to dress + two toilets and a balcony; this suite structure is not faithfully reproduced) (E2). Some walls appear incomplete/ambiguous due to transparency/partial geometry, reducing confidence in correct wall thickness and door embeddings (E6/E2). No clearly correct count/placement of bathrooms relative to bedrooms (E1/E2)."

Lighting is flat and materials are minimal. Geometry clarity is compromised by partial/ghosted surfaces and indistinct edges (E6). Composition is okay but not clean enough for verification."

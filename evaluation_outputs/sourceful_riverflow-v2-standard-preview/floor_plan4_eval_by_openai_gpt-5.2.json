        "notes": "Overall footprint roughly matches, and major zones (kitchen/dining top-left, living top-center, bedrooms right, wet/core bottom-center) are in the expected regions. However, the central hall/corridor geometry is distorted vs the plan (hall reads narrower and more fragmented), and the internal partitions around the bathroom/core do not align with the 2D wall layout. Multiple doors appear shifted from their plan locations and/or opened into different clearances. Window count/spacing along the top exterior wall does not match the plan\u2019s fenestration pattern, indicating placement inaccuracies. Several room proportions (hall and bedroom subareas) appear altered relative to the plan\u2019s stated areas."

        "notes": "Wall/door construction fidelity is weak: several doors look not properly embedded in walls (floating/odd jamb alignment), and the bathroom/core is subdivided differently than shown in the 2D plan (suggesting added partitions). Adjacency is mostly preserved at a high level, but the closet/bath/hall relationships are not faithfully replicated (closet placement and the bathroom internal arrangement diverge). At least one hall/utility subspace is either merged or reconfigured, and at least one extra compartment is introduced in the bathroom/core."

However, several pieces do not match the 2D layout orientations/positions (notably bedroom furnishings and some living-room placements), and some clearances implied by the 2D plan are not respected. Scale is generally consistent, but door swings and furniture-to-wall spacing feel inconsistent with the plan."

However, multiple door elements read as rendering/placement artifacts (awkward angles, inconsistent hinge behavior), reducing clarity. Projection is not strictly orthographic (noticeable perspective), and some edges/door panels appear visually inconsistent with the wall system."

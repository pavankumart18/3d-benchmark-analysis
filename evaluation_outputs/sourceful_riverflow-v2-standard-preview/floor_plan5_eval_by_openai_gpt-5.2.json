(E5/E2) 3D render shows an additional small bedroom/room at the far-right side that is not present in the 2D plan (plan appears to have 3 bedrooms; render reads as 4 sleeping rooms). (E2) The right-side service core (baths/closets) is rearranged: bathroom locations and corridor segmentation do not match the 2D plan\u2019s clustered bath areas. (E3/E2) Door locations and swing/orientation differ from plan (notably around the central living/dining transitions and bedroom entries). (E2) Balcony/terrace configuration differs: render includes prominent terraces with railings whose size/placement does not cleanly match the smaller exterior projections in the plan. (E4) Proportions are off: central living/dining footprint vs. bedroom block widths and the right wing depth are distorted compared to the 2D outline."

(E2) Adjacency errors: the plan\u2019s room-to-room connections (especially the right bedroom/bath adjacency and corridor layout) do not match the render\u2019s corridor and closet placements. (E5) Hallucinated extra room used as a bedroom on the far-right. (E1) At least one planned small ancillary space/exterior projection is not represented as drawn (plan indicates smaller protrusions; render consolidates/reshapes them). (E3) Door embedding/orientation inconsistent with plan where several openings appear moved or resized. Wall thickness looks generally consistent visually, but the wall graph (where walls exist) differs substantially from the plan."

(E4) Some furniture scale feels inconsistent relative to room sizes due to proportion distortion (e.g., dining table vs. circulation widths)."

Lighting is clean and geometry is mostly crisp with minimal artifacts. Composition is clear; however, large openings/railings and simplified glazing read as stylized rather than plan-accurate."

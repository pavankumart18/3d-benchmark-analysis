        "notes": "Major layout mismatches versus plan: the long DECK along the top of Living & Dining is not represented as an exterior deck space (E1/E2). Both balconies (Bedroom-2 top balcony and Bedroom-1 right balcony) are not clearly modeled as balconies and their access openings are not placed as in plan (E1/E2). Window placement deviates strongly: render shows a near-continuous ribbon of windows along the top fa\u00e7ade, not matching the plan\u2019s localized openings/sliders at deck/balconies and specific room walls (E2). Several door locations/orientations appear simplified/shifted (notably deck/balcony access and some bath entries), and overall room shapes feel normalized compared to the plan\u2019s jogs/offsets (E2/E3). Proportions appear altered (Living/Dining depth and right-side bedroom/balcony massing) (E4)."

        "notes": "Adjacency is partly preserved (3 bedrooms, kitchen central, office/maid left, toilets clustered), but exterior features are structurally incorrect: missing deck and balconies (E1) significantly change envelope and circulation. Door embedding/orientation is inconsistent with the plan at exterior interfaces (deck/balconies) and at least one internal corridor transition appears simplified (E2/E3). Wall thickness is mostly consistent visually, but several plan wall jogs/offsets are reduced, impacting fidelity (E4). No clear hallucinated additional rooms, but hallucinated continuous glazing is present (E5)."

However, furniture arrangement does not reliably follow the 2D plan (e.g., living seating/dining alignment relative to deck opening, and bedroom/balcony-side placement), and some pieces appear scaled/placed to fit the altered geometry rather than the plan (E2/E4)."

Camera is a standard isometric/axonometric-like view, though not strictly orthographic. Lighting is even but somewhat flat. Geometry is mostly clean; main visual issue is the unrealistic continuous window band and simplified exterior massing, which reduces architectural believability."

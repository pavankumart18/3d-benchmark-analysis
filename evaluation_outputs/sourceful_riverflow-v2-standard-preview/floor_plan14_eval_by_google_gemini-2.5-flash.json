The kitchen wall facing the foyer is absent in the 3D model. Door placements are largely correct, but there are some discrepancies and missing doors. Window placements are frequently incorrect or missing. Room proportions are distorted in several areas, particularly the utility and common toilet adjacent to Bed-2, and the foyer area."

Door embedding is mostly correct where doors exist, but some are missing. Adjacency relationships are mostly maintained, but the missing wall between the kitchen and foyer is a major structural alteration. There are missing rooms (e.g., the deck off Bed-2, and the utility room in size specified) and hallucinated elements (e.g., a wall added near the main entrance that isn't on the floor plan)."

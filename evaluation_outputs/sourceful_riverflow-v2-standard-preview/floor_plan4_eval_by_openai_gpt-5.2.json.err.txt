    "notes": "Overall room zoning roughly matches (open kitchen/dining left, living center, bedrooms right, bath/laundry bottom), but the hall/entry region is significantly re-partitioned compared to the plan. Several interior wall runs do not align with the 2D plan (notably around the hall, laundry/closet area, and the bathroom/closet cluster). Door locations and swings frequently do not match the 2D plan, causing circulation paths to differ. Window counts/spacing along the long top wall and some side-wall placements appear shifted from the plan. Bedroom and hall proportions appear distorted (hall reads narrower/more corridor-like than the plan’s larger hall)."

    "notes": "Exterior shell and major adjacencies are mostly preserved, but internal partition fidelity is weak in the entry/hall and laundry/closet zone. Multiple doors appear incorrectly embedded/positioned (some read as floating/oddly hinged). Closet layout/dooring does not consistently match the plan (closet count/locations and access points differ). Additional short partition(s) appear in the living/hall boundary that are not indicated on the 2D plan."

    "notes": "Dining table and primary living seating are placed in the expected general areas, but exact furniture arrangement/orientation differs from the 2D symbols. Bedroom furniture placement is approximate and does not clearly match the plan layouts (desk/wardrobe positions and bed clearances differ). Some furniture scale feels inconsistent relative to room sizes (especially in the hall/bath cluster where space reads tighter than the plan)."

    "notes": "Isometric/top-down camera is generally correct and visually readable, with decent lighting and materials. However, the view is not strictly orthographic and there are noticeable geometry/door artifacts (doors look oddly placed/angled), reducing technical clarity. Overall composition is clean but undermined by the interior-partition inaccuracies."

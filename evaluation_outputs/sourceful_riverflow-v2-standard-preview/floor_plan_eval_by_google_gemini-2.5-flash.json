Wall alignments have several inaccuracies, particularly around the kitchen/closet area and both bathrooms. Many doors are incorrectly placed or oriented. Window placement is generally fair, except for the large living room windows which are rendered as a single structure rather than two distinct window sets with a central wall section. Room proportions are distorted, especially the main living area, guest bathroom, and Rachel's bedroom."

        "notes": "Overall room zoning roughly matches (Activity left, Bath/WC central, three bedrooms right), but several spatial placements deviate. Balcony in the 3D appears larger/deeper and more open than the 2D balcony footprint (proportion/extent mismatch). The small hall/circulation node between Bath/WC and bedrooms is simplified and door locations along this junction do not align well with the 2D plan. Window runs are rendered as long continuous bands/sliders where the 2D shows more discrete openings/segments. Bedroom and robe proportions appear altered (especially Bed 3/Bed 4 robe wall lengths)."

        "notes": "Primary adjacencies are mostly preserved (Bath and WC adjacent; bedrooms grouped), but multiple labeled architectural elements from the plan are not represented: LINEN cupboard, A/C cupboards, and the RECESS near stairs. Balcony boundary conditions (wall/balustrade and partial-height wall notes) are not faithfully modeled. Door embedding is inconsistent with plan intent at the central junction (several doors shifted and/or simplified), reducing fidelity even if the overall partition layout is similar."

Activity room and balcony furniture is largely invented relative to the plan (TV unit, sectional/benching, outdoor lounge arrangement). Scale feels visually consistent, but it does not map tightly to the 2D furniture indications."

However, the render leans toward stylized continuous glazing and simplified wall/door detailing, which reduces orthographic/architectural exactness compared to the plan."

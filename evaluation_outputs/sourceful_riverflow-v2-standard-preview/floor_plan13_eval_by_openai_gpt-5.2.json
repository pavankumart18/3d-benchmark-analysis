(E2) Lounge/Dining zone is not in the correct position relative to Kitchen/Bath core; in the 2D plan lounge is left with balcony at top-left, while the 3D render places a large lounge-like space on the right side. (E1) Balcony space and its connection to lounge are missing. (E2/E3) Kitchen location/shape does not match the plan\u2019s compact top-middle kitchen with adjacent laundry/robe; the 3D kitchen reads as relocated and simplified. (E2/E3) Bathroom/WC core position and door openings do not correspond to the plan\u2019s central bottom bath + separate WC. (E4) Room proportions are off: lounge is oversized and bedrooms/circulation widths do not preserve the plan\u2019s compact central hallway and measured room sizes."

(E2) Adjacencies are incorrect: the plan has two bedrooms stacked on the right with shared hallway access; the 3D distributes sleeping areas differently. (E1) Garage (shown as a separate volume in the 2D plan) is not represented. (E1) Laundry (L'dry/WM) and robe/linen storage shown in plan are not clearly present as distinct enclosed spaces. (E5) An extra bedroom/bed-space appears (3 beds shown vs 2 bedrooms in plan). Wall thickness/door embedding look visually consistent in the render, but they do not correspond to the plan\u2019s partition layout."

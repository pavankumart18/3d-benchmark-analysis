        "notes": "Overall zoning roughly matches (bedroom left, living/dining center, kitchen right, toilet near top-center/right), but several plan-defined spaces are not represented correctly. Balcony at bottom-left is not modeled as an open/attached exterior space and appears replaced by interior wall/window treatment (E1/E2). Utility (3'9\" wide) to the far right of kitchen is missing/merged (E1). Foyer (4'6\"x3'10\") at bottom-right is not clearly defined; entry seems to open into the main space without the plan\u2019s small foyer separation (E2/E4). Door positions do not match the plan\u2019s swing locations (bedroom/toilet/entry relationships are approximate but not aligned). Window locations/counts differ notably (extra/shifted glazing on exterior walls vs plan). Room proportions appear distorted: living space is over-enlarged relative to kitchen/foyer, and the toilet volume reads larger than 4'9\"x8'0\"."

Missing rooms: balcony and utility are not separately present (E1). Foyer separation is not respected (E2/E4). Toilet duct/shaft shown in plan is not represented (E1). Some partitions near the kitchen/toilet area appear reconfigured, creating a different circulation/partition layout than the plan (E2). No clear hallucinated additional full room, but interior partitions/corners not in the plan are introduced (E5, minor)."

No balcony furniture/usable balcony zone because balcony is missing (E1). Furniture scale is generally plausible, though dining/living clearances appear inconsistent with the tighter plan proportions (E4)."

Geometry is mostly clean with no major mesh artifacts; however, some openings/frames look simplified and not plan-accurate (clarity good, fidelity not)."

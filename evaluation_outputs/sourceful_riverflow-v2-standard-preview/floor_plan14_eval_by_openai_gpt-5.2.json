The 2D plan has two distinct decks/balconies (large deck off Living/Dining and small deck off Bed-1); the 3D render does not clearly model these as separate, correctly located exterior spaces. The Utility (5' x 7'8\") connected to the Kitchen is not clearly present as a separate room. Bathroom locations/entry orientations appear simplified and do not match the plan\u2019s exact placements. Window/opening placement is largely inconsistent with the plan."

        "notes": "Wall thickness appears visually consistent, but the plan\u2019s structural program is not faithfully preserved: missing decks and missing/merged utility substantially reduce fidelity. Adjacencies are partially correct (bedrooms connect to living zone), but the plan-specific relationships (Living-to-deck, Kitchen-to-utility, toilet placements) are not reliably reproduced. Doors are embedded as openings, but their exact positions and swing/orientation information from the 2D plan is not preserved."

Furniture scaling is generally consistent and not severely distorted."

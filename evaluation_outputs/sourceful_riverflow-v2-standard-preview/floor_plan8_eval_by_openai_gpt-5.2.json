(E2/E4) The 2D plan has clearly separated zones (Living Room left, Dining bottom-center, Kitchen right-center, Playroom top-right, Foyer/Closets/WC top-left, Stairs top-center). In the 3D render, several of these areas appear merged or not spatially separated as in plan, especially the Dining/Kitchen/Playroom relationships. (E2) The Pantry enclosure near the center is not clearly located/formed as shown in plan. (E3/E2) Door locations and swing/orientation shown in plan (foyer entry, closet/WC doors, pantry door, openings between dining/kitchen) are largely absent or represented as open voids without correct placement. (E2) Window placement does not match the plan\u2019s distributed perimeter windows; the 3D uses large glazed openings concentrated on certain walls. (E4) Room proportions (notably the bottom dining projection and right-side kitchen/playroom extents) appear distorted relative to the 2D footprint."

        "notes": "(E1) Several small program elements from the 2D plan are missing or not credibly modeled: the labeled Foyer/Closet/WC cluster at top-left and the Pantry as a defined room. (E2) Adjacencies are inconsistent: the 2D plan shows a distinct Playroom directly adjacent to the Kitchen with defined walls; the 3D render does not preserve this clear separation. (E3) Doors are not embedded as shown (no clear jambs/leafs; openings are simplified and do not match plan positions). (E4) Wall alignment/offsets and the plan\u2019s specific jogs/projections (notably around Dining and the Living Room perimeter) are only loosely approximated. No obvious extra (hallucinated) room is added, but multiple intended rooms are effectively omitted via merging."

The 2D plan\u2019s left side is a single bedroom with two twin beds, but the 3D render shows two separate small bedrooms (extra partition), changing room placement and circulation (E5/E2). The 2D plan has a clearly enclosed living room zone at the bottom-middle with a defining interior wall; the 3D render presents a more open living/dining arrangement and the interior wall geometry does not match (E2). Bathroom geometry and fixture placement differ: 2D shows a shower stall, toilet, and sink arrangement; 3D shows a bathtub-like fixture and altered layout (E1/E2). Several doors do not align with the 2D positions/swing orientations, especially around the central hall and bedroom entries (E2/E3). Windows are placed/counts/sizes differ substantially; 3D adds multiple large windows not reflected in 2D and misses the small/narrow openings shown in 2D (E2/E5). Room proportions (hall width and room sizes) appear distorted relative to the plan (E4)."

        "notes": "Adjacency relationships are partially preserved (kitchen/dining near bottom-right, right bedroom generally on right), but the left-side partitioning creates an additional room not present in the 2D plan (E5) and alters adjacency/circulation (E2). At least one required space is effectively missing in its intended form: the two-twin-bed bedroom is not represented as a single room (E1). Bathroom elements are substituted (shower->tub) (E1). Door embedding is inconsistent with the plan (multiple interior doors shifted) (E2/E3). Wall thickness is visually consistent within the render, but does not compensate for incorrect wall placement."

Living room furniture placement differs from the enclosed living room shown in 2D (E2). Bathroom fixtures are mismapped (E1/E2). Scales are plausible in isolation but inconsistent with the 2D-defined room sizes due to proportion/layout changes (E4)."

However, it is not orthographic/plan-faithful (noticeable perspective/isometric stylization is fine, but fidelity to the floor plan is low). Composition is clear, but the incorrect structural layout reduces functional clarity relative to the source plan."

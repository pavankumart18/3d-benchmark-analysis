However, the wet-area block (toilet/utility) partitioning and access geometry appear simplified/shifted versus the 2D plan (E2/E4). Entry door condition at the top-left is not represented clearly in 3D, affecting circulation accuracy (E1). Door swing/orientation for internal doors (notably toilet) appears inconsistent with the 2D swing direction (E3). Window/opening positions are not consistently traceable to the 2D plan (toilet/utility/side openings) (E2). Some room size relationships (kitchen vs utility vs toilet) look proportionally off compared to labeled dimensions (E4)."

But the 3D omits/unclearly depicts the main entry door and likely simplifies door framing/embedding (E1/E2). The wardrobe/closet element shown on the 2D plan along the bedroom\u2019s upper wall is not modeled (E1). Interior partition layout around toilet/utility does not faithfully reproduce the 2D wall breaks/door locations (E2/E4). No clearly hallucinated extra rooms, but several openings appear added/changed relative to the plan (E5 risk on windows/openings)."

Some items from the 2D (e.g., bedroom built-in/wardrobe, smaller decor placements) are missing or not aligned to plan intent (E1/E2). Scale looks generally consistent, but circulation clearances differ due to partition/door deviations (E4)."

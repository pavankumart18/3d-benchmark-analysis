The 2D plan is essentially a single open Kitchen/Dining/Living zone with one small central bathroom and a large stair block at bottom-left plus a single entrance at bottom-center. The 3D render shows a multi-room layout (bedroom(s), multiple enclosed rooms and corridors) that does not correspond to the 2D room arrangement. Wall lines and room locations do not align; door and window positions do not match the plan; overall proportions and the open-plan relationship are not preserved."

Adjacency is wrong (2D has large open Living/Dining to the right; 3D subdivides into separate rooms). Multiple hallucinated rooms appear and the primary open space is effectively missing."

        "notes": "Overall massing resembles the plan (4 bedrooms around a central living/dining + kitchen), but several spaces are simplified or shifted. (E2/E4) Top-side decks are not represented with correct segmentation/shape: the plan has two distinct decks (large deck along living side + smaller deck off Bed-1), while the 3D shows a single continuous/ambiguous balcony strip. (E2/E4) The bottom service core (HQ + two small toilets) is not clearly preserved as separate rooms; the bottom zone reads as a simplified corridor/void. (E1/E2) Door placement/orientation cannot be verified accurately because openings are either missing or not placed where the plan indicates multiple hinged doors (foyer entry, bedroom doors, toilet doors). (E2/E3) Window placement is inconsistent: long continuous openings at the top edge do not match the plan\u2019s discrete window/door openings to the decks and room windows. (E2) Proportions are distorted in multiple rooms/circulation widths (e.g., living/dining depth vs. kitchen/foyer band), with corridors appearing widened and some rooms appearing more square than in plan.

        "notes": "Wall thickness is rendered fairly consistently, but interior partitions are simplified, especially in the bottom (foyer/HQ/toilets) and right-side wet areas. (E4) Door embedding correctness is weak: several expected door openings (to toilets, foyer, utility) are not clearly cut/located as per plan. (E2/E3) Adjacencies are partially correct (kitchen adjacent to dining; bedrooms grouped), but the plan\u2019s specific service adjacency (utility + common toilet cluster near center-right; HQ/toilet cluster at bottom) is not faithfully maintained. (E2) At least one room cluster appears missing/merged (HQ and the two small toilets at bottom). (E1) No clear evidence of additional fully new rooms, but the balcony/deck configuration reads as a hallucinated merge of two decks into one continuous element. (E5)"

Wall alignment differs notably: the 2D plan has a non-rectilinear/angled left exterior wall and a more articulated interior partition layout; the 3D render shows a mostly rectangular perimeter and different partition offsets (E2, E4). Door placement/orientation is inaccurate: several interior doors shown in the plan (notably bedroom entry and bathroom/closet doors) are not represented with correct swing/orientation; at least one appears relocated (E2, E3). Window placement is incorrect: the plan shows multiple openings along the bottom fa\u00e7ade and other positions; the 3D render uses a different distribution (missing bottom windows and adding/relocating openings on side walls) (E2, E1). Proportions are distorted: the bedroom and service core sizes/ratios do not match the plan\u2019s relative dimensions (E4)."

Door embedding is simplified (no clear jamb/swing logic), and several door locations do not align to the plan (E2, E3). Adjacency is partially correct (bedroom adjacent to service core; living adjacent to service core), but the service rooms are reconfigured, changing internal adjacencies (E2). Missing room/zone detail: the plan\u2019s distinct small rooms/closet/laundry-like nook are not clearly preserved as separate, correctly shaped spaces (E1, E2). Hallucinated/altered internal geometry: the 3D shows a bulky, irregular interior block/void-like partitioning in the service area not matching the plan\u2019s wall layout (E5/E2)."

Living furniture placement is generic and does not match the plan\u2019s sofa/table arrangement (E2). Bedroom furniture is missing/incorrect (plan shows a bed; 3D does not depict it clearly) (E1). Scale consistency is also weak: several furniture blocks appear underspecified and not proportioned to the room sizes as in the plan (E4)."

Geometry is generally clean, but the service-core massing looks blocky and ambiguous relative to the intended partitions (E6). Visual clarity is decent, but the lack of accurate openings/doors reduces interpretability."

        "notes": "Major footprint/layout mismatch: the 2D plan is an irregular shape with a large 2-car garage mass on the right and two covered patios; the 3D render shows an almost rectangular perimeter without the garage/patio massing. The master suite region (top-right in plan, with angled/tray geometry and WIC/master bath arrangement) is not reproduced with the same room shapes or placement. Hallway network and room placements (study/dining/kitchen/nook relationships) do not align to the plan. Door locations/orientations are largely not evidenced in the render and do not appear to match the plan\u2019s patio/room connections. Window runs (notably the long band across the living room side in plan) are not placed/quantified consistently, and several exterior openings appear in different positions. Overall room proportions and adjacency lengths are significantly distorted by the simplified rectangular shell."

        "notes": "Wall thickness appears relatively uniform in the render, but the structural layout does not preserve required adjacencies (garage-to-utility, utility-to-hall, master bed-to-master bath/WIC). Multiple plan-defined spaces are absent, and the exterior massing is altered (rectangularized), indicating structural non-fidelity. Several interior partitions appear invented/simplified relative to the plan, creating rooms/corridors that do not correspond to the 2D diagram."

        "notes": "Furniture is generic and only loosely suggests a living/dining zone and bedrooms; it does not map to the plan\u2019s specific room identities (study, nook, kitchen work triangle/peninsula, utility) or their exact locations. Scale feels approximate, but without matching room geometry the furniture-to-room correspondence is largely unreliable."

However, the render is blurry/low-detail with soft, smeared textures and limited edge definition (artifact-like). Lighting is serviceable but flat. Geometry is mostly clean, though overall presentation lacks crispness and clear architectural features (doors/frames/openings)."

Several doors are rendered as arched openings rather than embedded hinged doors shown in plan. Bedroom window walls and some closet boundaries do not structurally match the 2D layout; some openings/wall segments appear invented or simplified."

However, the projection reads more like perspective than strict isometric/orthographic, and the frequent arched openings plus simplified wall/door geometry reduces architectural clarity. Minor softness/blur and simplified detailing detract from verification-grade legibility."

However, several openings and internal layout cues deviate: the main entrance double-door shown on the 2D plan is not clearly present in the 3D; Bedroom 1 appears to be missing the left-wall window; Kitchen fenestration appears different (extra/shifted windows). Kitchen fixture arrangement (notably sink/run layout) does not match the 2D U-shape intent. Some relative proportions (kitchen vs. hall/corridor width) appear slightly expanded in 3D."

Wall thickness is generally consistent and doors are embedded, but the entry condition from the 2D plan is structurally ambiguous/missing in the 3D. No clearly extra rooms are introduced, and all primary rooms appear present."

Kitchen cabinetry/appliance/sink placement does not closely follow the 2D layout. Furniture scale is mostly consistent, with minor mismatches in living seating arrangement versus the 2D depiction."

Geometry is mostly clean; composition is clear but some openings (notably the entrance) are not visually explicit, reducing interpretability."

Major mismatch in balcony locations (central living/dining balcony in plan is not represented correctly; balconies appear at ends instead). Internal circulation/wide passages shown in plan are not preserved; room proportions and corridor widths appear compressed/reshaped. Door and window layouts do not align reliably with the plan."

        "notes": "Wall thickness looks somewhat consistent in the render, but structural/plan fidelity is weak: the plan\u2019s defined toilet block count and placement (multiple toilets including a powder toilet) is not faithfully reconstructed. The kitchen\u2013utility relationship from the plan is not clearly preserved (utility appears missing or merged). Adjacencies are partially correct (kitchen on right, bedrooms grouped), but key planned connections (living-to-balcony, passage structure) deviate. At least one extra balcony/terrace-like element is introduced that is not supported by the 2D plan."

Placement does not reliably map to the 2D plan\u2019s exact room boundaries/openings. Furniture scale appears mostly plausible, but the mapping accuracy to the specified layout is low."

        "notes": "Isometric view is generally correct and the model reads as an isometric cutaway. However, visual clarity is reduced by soft/blurred rendering and low-detail geometry. Lighting is acceptable but flat. Some geometry feels simplified, and openings (doors/windows) are not crisply defined, harming interpretability."

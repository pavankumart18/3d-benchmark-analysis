The 2D plan\u2019s clear separation of PLAYROOM (top-right), KITCHEN (right-center), DINING (bottom-center), LIVING (left), FOYER/CLOSETS/WC/STAIRS (top-left/top-center) is not cleanly reproduced. Stair core at top-center is not clearly present/legible in the 3D, and the foyer/closet/WC cluster appears merged/simplified. Dining-room bay/projection and several wall jogs are not matched, causing noticeable proportion and wall-alignment drift. Door and window locations/counts do not correspond well to the plan."

Wall thicknesses look generally consistent, but openings are not embedded where the plan indicates.

Door embedding is frequently incorrect, with doors opening into walls or at wrong angles. Adjacency relationships are mostly correct for main rooms, but the Utility and Service Room connection to the Kitchen is altered. Several rooms are missing, including the entire second Balcony. There are no hallucinated rooms, but a small wall is inappropriately added in the Foyer."

Lighting quality is dull and uniform, lacking depth or realism. Geometry shows some minor distortions, particularly in corners and wall junctions. Visual clarity is moderate, but the lack of windows and wall details reduces the overall composition."

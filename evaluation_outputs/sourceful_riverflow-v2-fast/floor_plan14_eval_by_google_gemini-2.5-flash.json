Door embedding is incorrect for several doors, appearing as cutouts rather than embedded within walls. The Utility room's dimensions seem altered leading to incorrect adjacency. The 'Foyer' from the plan is missing from the 3D model, and the 'C.TOI' next to Utility is missing, replaced by a slightly altered 'C.TOI' adjacent to BED-2."

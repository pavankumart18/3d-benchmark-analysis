        "notes": "Wall thickness appears generally consistent and geometry is coherent, but fidelity to the 2D structure is reduced by missing/changed openings, an apparent omission of the small 3'x2' space below the bathroom, altered adjacency at the kitchen-hall interface (door replaced by open passage/shifted wall), and hallucinated exterior openings on the left wall."

Furniture in the render is plausible for the living/dining area, but scale and placement cannot be confirmed against the plan; some circulation clearances appear tight around the dining set and central partitions."

Minor issues: some shapes (stairs/inner partitions) look simplified/blocky relative to architectural detail; projection is perspective-isometric rather than strict orthographic isometric."

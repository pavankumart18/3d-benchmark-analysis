(E2/E4) Overall massing/outline does not preserve the plan\u2019s stepped perimeter (especially the balcony recess and left-side indentation), causing proportion and footprint distortion. (E2) Central wet-area cluster (Bath + WC + A/C niche) appears reconfigured/shifted; partition locations and corridor geometry do not match the plan. (E2/E3) Several door openings are not placed/oriented per the plan (hall-to-bedroom and hall-to-bath/WC door positions are inconsistent and some appear absent). (E2) Window placements do not match: plan shows multiple fa\u00e7ade windows (e.g., along Bed 3 outer wall and Activity), but the render concentrates windows mainly on the right/top faces and omits others."

(E2) Adjacency relationships are altered: the Activity-to-balcony connection is lost, and the hall/wet-area arrangement is inconsistent with the plan. (E1/E2) Stair/recess zone at top-left of Activity (shown in plan) is not clearly represented as a stair opening/landing recess in the 3D. (E4) Wall runs and thicknesses are not consistently preserved; several partitions look simplified/merged. (E5) Some interior partitions/voids appear introduced that are not evidenced in the 2D plan."

Orthographic/isometric correctness is moderate; composition is fine but lacks plan-accurate detail."

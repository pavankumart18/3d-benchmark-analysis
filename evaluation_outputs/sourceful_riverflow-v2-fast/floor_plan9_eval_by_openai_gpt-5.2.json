        "notes": "Overall room clustering is recognizable (garage bottom-right, master suite top-right, secondary bedrooms right side, public spaces left/center), but multiple plan-defining geometries are simplified or altered. The 2D plan\u2019s distinctive angled walls/entries (living-room corner near master corridor; kitchen peninsula angles; several jogs in exterior walls) are largely orthogonalized in the 3D. Door locations/swing/orientation are not consistently matched (notably patio access and several interior room entries). Window positions are not faithfully reproduced (few/unclear openings where the plan shows many exterior windows). Room proportions appear off: garage depicted larger (labeled 2.5 car) and some rooms/hall widths look widened/normalized compared to the plan."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is somewhat consistent but many wall offsets/jogs are missing, reducing fidelity to the plan. Several adjacency relationships are preserved (bedroom wing connected to hall; master suite adjacent to master bath/WIC; utility near garage), but key elements appear missing or merged (covered patios, nook articulation, pantry/closet definition). The garage is hallucinated as larger than specified (2.5 car vs 2 car). Overall structure reads as a simplified reinterpretation rather than a precise extrusion of the 2D plan."

Kitchen configuration appears changed (plan shows an angled peninsula and specific appliance placement; 3D shows a more conventional island/linear setup). Some room uses are implied correctly (beds in bedrooms, seating in living), but scale and placement are not verifiable as matching the plan."

Lighting is soft and readable, but the render is somewhat blurry/low-detail, reducing legibility of openings and fine geometry. Geometry is clean overall, though simplification introduces a 'boxy' look inconsistent with the plan\u2019s angled segments."

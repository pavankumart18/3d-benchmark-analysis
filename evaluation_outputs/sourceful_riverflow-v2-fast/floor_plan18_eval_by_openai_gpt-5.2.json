        "notes": "Overall zoning roughly matches (bedroom left, toilet near center/top, kitchen+utility right, living/dining front), but several plan-defined openings and exterior breaks are not respected. Balcony area is not clearly modeled as an exterior balcony volume; living-to-balcony connection appears as a window/opening instead of a door. Door locations are generalized/shifted (many openings shown as undetailed archways), and window positions/counts do not consistently match the 2D plan. Room proportions appear drifted: the living/dining reads larger and more open than the plan suggests, while the foyer separation is unclear."

        "notes": "Wall network broadly resembles the plan footprint, but key adjacency/threshold definitions are weakened: doors are not embedded as hinged doors with correct swing/orientation, and several transitions are represented as open arches. Balcony is effectively missing as a distinct room/outdoor space. Utility/kitchen boundary and the small passage/door logic around toilet/bedroom do not read as faithfully partitioned as in the plan. No clear evidence of extra full rooms, but multiple openings/partitions look invented or simplified."

Kitchen fixtures/counters are simplified and do not clearly follow the L-shape/counter placement from plan. Several furniture pieces appear as generic blobs with ambiguous function/scale."

        "notes": "Isometric view is generally correct and readable. Lighting is clean and neutral; geometry is mostly clean. However, many openings are stylized as arches and details are overly smoothed, reducing orthographic/plan-faithful clarity. Some elements look soft/underdetailed, which hurts verification-grade legibility."

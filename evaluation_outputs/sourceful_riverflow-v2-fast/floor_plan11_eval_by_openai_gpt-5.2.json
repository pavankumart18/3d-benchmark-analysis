The 3D appears to depict a simplified apartment-like arrangement with a large open room and a bedroom-like space, not the same room placement or boundaries as shown. Several interior partitions and key circulation paths (central hall connections, utility/WC cluster) are not aligned to the plan (E2/E4). Door locations and swing/orientation are largely absent or inconsistent (E1/E2/E3). Window placement/count does not match the plan\u2019s prominent dining/kitchen/breakfast openings and window-seat geometry (E2/E1). Room proportions are significantly altered (dining room footprint and the right-side angled/window-seat/breakfast edge are not preserved) (E4)."

Multiple labeled rooms/features from the plan are missing in the 3D (WC, Utility Room details, Pantry, Breakfast area, Window-seat/angled bay, Central Hall as drawn, Alcove/crawlspace access/stair zone) (E1). No clear evidence of correct door embedding in walls (few/none modeled) (E1/E2). Wall thickness is rendered uniformly but not verified against plan intent; however, the larger issue is missing/misplaced partitions rather than thickness (E2/E1). No strong evidence of additional fully hallucinated rooms beyond a bedroom-like space not present in the provided plan segment (possible) (E5)."

        "notes": "Overall room zoning roughly matches (left bedroom + bath/office strip + right bedroom + open living/dining/kitchen), but several plan-to-render mismatches: corridor and central hall widths are enlarged, shifting wall positions (E4). Door locations/swing logic do not consistently match the 2D plan (notably along the top corridor and into the right bedroom/hall) (E2/E3). Window placement is significantly inaccurate: the 2D plan shows windows on the top edge (bath/office) and a kitchen/sink-side opening, while the render primarily shows right-side glazing and omits/relocates others (E1/E2)."

Adjacencies are mostly preserved (bath and office remain between bedrooms; open area remains on the right), yet exact wall breaks and doorway connections differ (E2). No major room is completely missing, but some plan-defined boundary/partition behaviors (living room partial enclosure) are simplified/shifted (E2/E4)."

Some scale relationships (hall vs. room usable area) appear inconsistent with the plan (E4)."

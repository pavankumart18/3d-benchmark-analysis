        "notes": "Overall layout resembles the 2D plan (2 beds, central living/dining, decks at top-left and top-right), but multiple spatial deviations exist: living/dining footprint appears widened (labeled ~19' vs 15' in plan), kitchen/foyer zone is heavily distorted into an oversized corridor-like area, TOI-1 geometry differs from plan, and windows from the 2D plan are largely not represented. Door locations/orientations are not reliably consistent with the plan (entry/foyer door sequence especially)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is generally consistent, but fidelity to the plan\u2019s partitioning is weak around the foyer/kitchen/utility and toilet cores. Adjacencies are partly maintained (Bed-1 near TOI-1 and right deck; Bed-2 near left side; living central), yet the plan\u2019s tight foyer is not preserved and becomes a large open hall. Several openings/doors are simplified and not embedded/placed as per the 2D drawing. Some spaces appear added/expanded beyond plan intent."

Furniture scale is generally coherent, though the living/dining furnishing does not match the 2D arrangement."

However, it is not orthographically faithful to the 2D plan due to noticeable proportion drift (notably living/dining and foyer/kitchen corridor). Visual clarity is good but plan-to-render accuracy is the limiting factor."

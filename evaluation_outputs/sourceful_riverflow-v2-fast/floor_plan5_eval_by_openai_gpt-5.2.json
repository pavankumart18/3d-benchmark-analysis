Several rooms in the left side read as bedrooms in 3D where 2D indicates kitchen/living adjacency (E2). Interior door locations along the central living/hall junction on the right side do not match the 2D plan\u2019s door distribution/swing directions (E2/E3). Exterior window groupings on the right and top edges do not align with the 2D window positions/count (E2).

At least one small ancillary space/bathroom cluster from the 2D (top-center and top-right wet areas) is not clearly preserved as two distinct bathrooms in 3D (E1/E2). A bedroom count/partitioning appears higher in 3D than the 2D plan suggests (possible extra bedroom/space) (E5). Wall thicknesses are visually uniform but do not reflect any plan-based variation; several doors appear embedded in locations that do not match the plan\u2019s wall openings (E2)."

        "notes": "Overall massing roughly matches (central living/dining, bedrooms distributed left/right), but several plan-to-render mismatches: balcony/deck configuration appears simplified into a more continuous edge rather than two distinct decks (top-left large deck + top-right deck). Service/core area at bottom-left (foyer/HO/toilets) is not clearly preserved; circulation and partitions look rearranged. Multiple door locations/orientations are not verifiable or appear shifted (notably along the bedroom corridor and into bathrooms). Window runs along the top fa\u00e7ade look over-continuous vs. segmented openings in plan. Room proportions appear distorted (living/dining and kitchen feel resized; corridor widths and bathroom sizes appear inconsistent with the tight plan)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is rendered fairly consistently, but interior partition layout in the foyer/HO/toilet cluster is not faithfully reproduced. Adjacency is partially correct (kitchen near living; bedrooms adjacent to corridor), yet bathroom/utility relationships appear altered. At least one small service room (HO/store-like space) is not clearly represented, and toilet count/placement appears reduced or reconfigured. No obvious extra 'new' major rooms, but balcony geometry and some internal niches appear invented/smoothed compared to the plan."

Some furniture scales look generic and may not respect the tight bathroom/utility dimensions shown in 2D."

Geometry is mostly clean, though balcony/window bands are simplified and reduce plan-readability. Overall clarity is good but fidelity to 2D constraints is weakened by smoothing/merging elements."

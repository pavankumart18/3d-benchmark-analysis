Alfresco placement/extent does not match the large top-right outdoor zone in the 2D plan. Several internal partitions (recesses, linen/WIR/WC separations) appear simplified/merged, affecting room boundaries and circulation."

However, furniture does not reliably map to named rooms (e.g., theatre seating vs. living, activity space definition), and scaling/fit-to-room is approximate due to missing/merged room partitions."

        "notes": "Overall layout resembles the plan (dining top-left, kitchen top area, bedroom left, stair zone bottom-right), but several key spatial mismatches exist. The dedicated entrance/foyer at the top-right with the double-door entry shown in 2D is not clearly present in the 3D (E1/E2). The right-side main room is labeled/treated as a different space (\u201cWash room\u201d) rather than the Living Room and its boundaries/read are inconsistent with the 2D living room footprint (E2/E5). Kitchen geometry appears simplified to a near-rectangle and does not preserve the 2D plan\u2019s wall offsets/notches and relationships to the entry zone (E4/E2). Internal circulation and the central core (wash/toilet) alignment appears shifted relative to the hall/living connection shown in 2D (E2)."

Several walls appear reinterpreted, producing different room boundaries (notably the right-side main room) (E2). Door integration is unclear/incomplete: the 2D shows a prominent double entry door and specific internal doors to bedroom/wash; the 3D does not convincingly match these placements/orientations (E2/E3). Potential hallucinated room labeling/function (\u201cWash room\u201d as a large right-side space) not supported by the 2D (E5)."

Geometry is generally clean, but the presentation lacks clarity on doors/entry and fine architectural elements (door swings/frames) which reduces interpretability. Window slits are stylized and not clearly matched to the plan."

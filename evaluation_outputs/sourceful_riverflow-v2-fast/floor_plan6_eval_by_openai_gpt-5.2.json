The right-side stair zone shown in the 2D plan is not represented in the 3D model (space is instead treated as regular room fa\u00e7ade with windows) (E1/E2). Bedroom position appears shifted to the left/front in the 3D (bed placed along the main windowed fa\u00e7ade), while the plan locates the bedroom at the top-right (E2). Central core (bath/closet/hall) geometry and wall alignment do not match the plan\u2019s clean rectangular partitions (E2). Exterior entry locations from the plan (left-side door and bottom-right door) are not clearly present/placed correctly in the 3D (E1/E2). Window counts and positions do not correspond to the plan (E2/E4). Room proportions are distorted: the main living zone and bedroom proportions relative to the core differ noticeably (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall thicknesses appear more uniform than the plan\u2019s heavy exterior vs lighter interior convention, but multiple partitions do not follow the plan\u2019s adjacency logic (E2). The stairwell/vertical circulation element on the right edge of the plan is missing entirely (E1), breaking key adjacency relationships (hall\u2194stairs, stairs\u2194entry) (E2). Door embedding/orientation is inconsistent: several planned swing doors (bedroom/bath/hall) are not clearly modeled or are relocated (E1/E2/E3). The 3D introduces an over-complicated central cluster of small volumes compared to the plan, suggestive of extra/altered rooms or closets (E5)."

Kitchen island/counter arrangement is only loosely similar and appears shifted relative to the plan\u2019s kitchen location (E2). Furniture scale is generally plausible, but placement-to-room association is frequently incorrect (E2)."

However, openings/windows look generic and repetitive, reducing fidelity/clarity to the source plan. No major rendering artifacts, but some wall/void transitions appear simplified compared to architectural detailing."

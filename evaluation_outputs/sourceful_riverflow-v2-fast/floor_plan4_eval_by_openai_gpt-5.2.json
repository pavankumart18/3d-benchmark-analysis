        "notes": "Overall layout resembles the plan (open kitchen/dining at left, living central, two bedrooms at right, bath near center-right), but several spatial mismatches exist. Notable deviations include a staircase/level-change element inserted in the living area, inconsistent interior wall segment lengths (especially around hall/bath/bedroom junction), and multiple door locations/orientations that do not match the 2D swings. Window distribution and sizes also diverge from the plan (fewer/different openings, several rendered as large glazed units). Room proportion balance is altered (living/hall and bath zone read differently sized than in plan)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent and doors are generally embedded, but fidelity to the 2D partitioning is reduced around the service core (laundry/closets/bath). Adjacency is mostly correct at a high level, yet at least one closet/service space from the plan is not clearly represented as a distinct enclosed room. A non-plan element (stairs/steps) is introduced, constituting a structural hallucination."

Some items (laundry equipment/storage/closet fittings) are missing or not identifiable, and a few scales feel inconsistent with the implied room sizes (living circulation feels constrained relative to furniture)."

Minor issues: projection is slightly perspective rather than strict orthographic isometric; some geometry reads simplified (door/window detailing and openings) and the inserted stair/step element reduces visual/architectural credibility relative to the source plan."

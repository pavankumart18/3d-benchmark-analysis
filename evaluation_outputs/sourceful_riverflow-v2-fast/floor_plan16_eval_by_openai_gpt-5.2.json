However, the right-side service/shaft zone is modeled differently than the plan (partitioning and widths don\u2019t align), several window spans (especially along the bottom/bedroom side and balcony glazing) appear longer/different than indicated, and balcony depth/room proportions read enlarged in the 3D compared to the stated 7'10\" x 3'5\" balcony and 10'0\" x 16'7\" living proportions. Some door swing/orientation details (notably the toilet entry) are not clearly consistent with the 2D swing depiction."

Main penalty is for the altered/misrepresented right-side shaft/closet/duct area (extra/shifted partitions vs the single marked shaft/void in plan), which introduces potential hallucinated subspaces and changes to wall alignment in that zone. No major room is missing."

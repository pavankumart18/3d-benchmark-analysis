Adjacency relationships are mostly preserved, but the utility room connection to the kitchen is unclear. There are no completely missing or hallucinated rooms, but the Utility room's internal structure is poorly rendered."

Other furniture items, like the wardrobe and study table in the bedroom, are missing. Scale consistency is acceptable for placed items, but not accurate to the floorplan due to many missing items."

Geometry is mostly clean but lacks fine details for doors and windows. Visual clarity is moderate due to poor lighting and missing elements, and composition is passable."

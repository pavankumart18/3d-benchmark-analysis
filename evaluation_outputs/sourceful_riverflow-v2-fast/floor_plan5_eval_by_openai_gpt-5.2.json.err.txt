    "notes": "Overall exterior footprint is broadly similar (left and right projecting volumes present), but several interior spaces do not match the 2D plan. The far-left room in the plan (appears as a living/dining-like space) is rendered as a bedroom in 3D (E2/E5). Internal partition alignment around the central living/dining and the right-side corridor/bedroom cluster deviates, changing circulation paths (E2). Multiple door locations/swing orientations shown in 2D are simplified/shifted in 3D (several openings appear centered differently or treated as open portals) (E2/E3). Window count/positioning on exterior walls does not consistently match the 2D plan (some windows missing, others resized/relocated) (E1/E2). Room proportions are not preserved: the central living zone and some bedrooms appear stretched compared to the plan’s relative dimensions (E4)."

    "notes": "Wall thickness is fairly consistent visually, but internal wall layout does not faithfully reproduce the plan’s adjacency relationships (e.g., left block and right-side bedroom/bath arrangement) (E2). Several doors are not embedded/specified as in the 2D plan (missing leaf/swing clarity; some are modeled as wide open cutouts) (E2/E6). At least one planned room/function is effectively missing or transformed (left room becoming a bedroom) (E1/E2). The 3D also introduces a bedroom-like program where the 2D indicates a different space, qualifying as a hallucinated program element (E5)."

    "notes": "Central living/dining furniture generally matches the idea of the plan (dining table central; seating group nearby), but multiple rooms’ furniture programs differ from the 2D (notably the far-left room rendered as a bedroom) (E2/E5). Furniture scale looks generally consistent and coherent in 3D, with no extreme size anomalies."

Lighting is soft and readable; geometry is mostly clean with minor blur/low-resolution artifacts. Composition is clear, but openings/doors lack crisp definition compared to the plan."

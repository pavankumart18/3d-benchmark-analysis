The door to the M.Bedroom toilet is also misplaced. Window placement is mostly incorrect, with windows appearing on walls that do not have them in the floor plan or being different sizes/numbers. Room proportions are mostly maintained, but some wall alignments are slightly off, particularly in the living and dining area."

The wall separating the living area from the left-most balcony is missing partially. The wall between the balcony and 'M.Bedroom' has a missing part. Some door embeddings are not correct, as they open into the middle of a wall rather than creating a proper entryway. No missing or hallucinated rooms."

However, several plan-accurate details deviate: balcony appears extended/wraps beyond the plan footprint (E5/E2). Core wet-area/utility zone (bath/WC/laundry/robe) is not clearly partitioned to match the 2D arrangement (E2/E1), and multiple interior door positions/orientations are inconsistent or not verifiable from the render (E2/E3). Room proportions look inflated in the living/dining zone relative to the compact central service core shown in plan (E4). Window placements on the bedroom outer wall(s) are partially consistent, but not fully aligned to the 2D plan openings (E2)."

Wall thickness looks generally consistent, but the internal subdivision of laundry/robe/bath/WC does not faithfully replicate the plan (E1/E2). At least one of the small elements (entry linen closet and/or dedicated laundry nook and/or separate WC) appears missing or merged (E1). A major exterior feature (balcony/terrace) is expanded beyond the plan extent (E5/E2)."

(1) Balconies shown in the 2D plan (left master balcony and central living balcony) are not represented as exterior recess/terrace space in the 3D; exterior massing reads as a continuous wall line (E1/E2). (2) Circulation/wide passages in plan (two 1.10m wide passages and the entry approach into living/dining) are not preserved; the 3D reads as a different corridor geometry and room access pattern (E2/E4). (3) Kitchen/utility zone at bottom-right in plan is not clearly located/configured the same in 3D (counters appear shifted and the utility niche is not convincingly present) (E2/E1). (4) Door positions/orientations for bedroom/toilet entries are inconsistent with plan; several openings are placed differently relative to partitions (E2/E3). (5) Window/door-to-balcony placements do not match: plan has balcony doors and multiple fa\u00e7ade windows; 3D shows large windows but not aligned to the plan\u2019s openings, and lacks balcony door conditions (E2). Proportions of rooms appear compressed/squared versus the long linear plan (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness looks mostly uniform, but the structural layout fidelity is weak. (1) Missing balcony cutouts changes the outer wall footprint (E1). (2) Adjacency relationships are partially incorrect: living/dining-to-balcony connection and kitchen-to-utility relationship from plan are not preserved (E2). (3) Toilet count/layout appears inconsistent with the plan (plan includes multiple toilets including a powder toilet near entry; 3D does not clearly show the same number/placements) (E1/E2). (4) Door embedding/openings are not consistently located at the same partition segments as the 2D drawing (E2/E3). No clear evidence of additional fully hallucinated rooms beyond shifted partitions, but several partitions read as re-authored rather than translated (E2)."

Beds/sofas/tables exist but do not reliably match the 2D furnishing intent/positions; several rooms have mismatched layouts due to altered room geometry (E2). Scale feels somewhat inconsistent (e.g., seating/dining relative to room size) likely due to proportion changes (E4)."

However, camera is perspective rather than true orthographic/isometric, and some geometry feels simplified (missing balcony recesses and simplified fa\u00e7ade openings) which reduces architectural clarity. Overall composition is good; minor softness/blur and low detail in openings (E6)."

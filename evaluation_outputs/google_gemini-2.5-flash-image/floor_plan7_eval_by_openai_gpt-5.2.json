        "notes": "Overall layout (Dining top-left, Kitchen top-center, Living right, Bedroom bottom-left, Stairs bottom-right) generally matches the 2D plan. However, the central wet-area block deviates: the 2D shows a distinct Wash Area above the Toilet with its own enclosure and circulation, but the 3D reads as a simplified/merged space with different internal partitioning. Several door positions appear slightly shifted (notably Bedroom 1 entry and the wet-area entry), and window placement/count does not consistently match the plan (some openings appear omitted or relocated). Minor proportion differences are visible in the corridor/wet-area widths versus adjacent rooms."

Wall thickness is mostly consistent but varies at a few junctions. No clear extra (hallucinated) rooms, but at least one functional room (Wash Area) is not faithfully represented as a separate enclosed room as drawn."

However, kitchen/utility fixtures do not closely follow the 2D layout (counter/appliance layout simplified), and bathroom/wash fixtures appear rearranged relative to the planned wash/toilet separation. Some furniture scaling looks slightly off (seating and circulation clearance in Living)."

Camera is more top-down orthographic-like than a true isometric; perspective/angle is mild and not strongly isometric. Geometry is mostly clean with no major artifacts, though opening details (windows/doors) lack precision relative to the plan, reducing clarity of architectural intent."

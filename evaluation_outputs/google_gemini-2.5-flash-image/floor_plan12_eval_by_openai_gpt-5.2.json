Wall outlines and recess/stair zone are largely consistent. However, door set-outs are not fully faithful (WC door appears missing; Bed 2 door is unclear/absent; balcony access is shown as an opening without a defined door assembly). Window placement/extent appears simplified versus the plan (not all long window runs are clearly represented), and there are minor proportion shifts in the central hall/door clearances."

        "notes": "Wall thickness treatment is broadly consistent and room adjacencies are correct (Bath adjacent to WC; corridor serving Beds 2/3/4; Balcony connected to Activity). Main issue is architectural element fidelity at openings: at least one internal door is missing (WC) and another is not clearly embedded (Bed 2). No clear evidence of extra/hallucinated rooms; all programmed spaces appear present."

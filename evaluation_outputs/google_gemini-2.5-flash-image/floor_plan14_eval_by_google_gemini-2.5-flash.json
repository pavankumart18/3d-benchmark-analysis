Wall alignments exhibit minor inaccuracies, especially around the Kitchen and Foyer area where the wall is angled incorrectly. Door placements are generally accurate, but some orientations are incorrect. Window placements are largely consistent. Room proportions show some distortion, notably in the Kitchen and Foyer area, as well as the 'Deck' spaces which appear slightly smaller in the render."

Adjacency relationships are broadly maintained but specific wall junctions are off. There are no missing rooms, but a 'Deck' area from the floor plan appears to have an incorrect dimension and shape in the render (Deck 13'9\" X 5' has an incorrect, smaller rendered area). The second 'Deck' is also distorted in shape. There are no hallucinated rooms."

The distinctive angled/indented left exterior wall from the 2D plan is simplified/incorrect in the 3D (E4/E2). Several interior partitions around the bath/closet/utility core appear shifted, changing corridor widths and room shapes (E2). Door locations and swings are not faithfully reproduced (notably around the bedroom/bath core) (E2/E3). Window count/spacing along the long bottom wall does not match the repeated segments shown in the 2D plan (E2), and at least one exterior opening on the left side that reads as a door in the plan is not clearly present as a door in the 3D (E1)."

The closet/storage zone (hatched in plan) and the small utility/laundry zone are not clearly separated or are reinterpreted, altering adjacency and circulation (E1/E2). Some doors appear embedded but their exact wall segments and orientations differ from the plan (E2/E3). No clearly new full rooms are added, but the reconfiguration of the service core effectively hallucinates a different partition layout (E5)."

However, the living area furniture arrangement deviates (e.g., added desk/workstation not shown on plan; coffee table/sofa placement not tightly matching the 2D icons) (E5/E2). Some scale/proportion of furniture relative to room widths appears off due to the altered wall geometry (E4)."

Composition is readable, though openings (doors/windows) are not clearly differentiated enough to verify exact placements."

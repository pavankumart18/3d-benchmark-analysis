Bathroom footprint and proportions differ strongly (2D compact block near center; 3D is a long/narrow rectangle) (E4/E2). Entrance location appears shifted (2D centered on bottom wall; 3D placed left-of-center) (E2). Multiple door locations/orientations do not match the plan due to the added partition and altered circulation (E2/E3). Window count/locations on the right and top exterior walls do not match the 2D window markers (E2)."

Resulting adjacency relationships are incorrect: in 2D Dining and Living are contiguous zones; in 3D they are separated by a wall and a door (E2). Bathroom enclosure geometry is not faithful (shape and likely wall runs differ) (E4/E2). Wall thickness appears mostly consistent, but door embedding and openings do not correspond reliably to the 2D door positions (E2/E3)."

Some furniture scale feels plausible, but placement reflects the incorrect room partitioning (E2)."

However, there are noticeable overlay/text artifacts on the floor (dimension labels) and some elements (orange highlights/markers) read like rendering/UI artifacts rather than architectural components (E6). Overall composition is clear but architecturally misleading due to structural deviations."

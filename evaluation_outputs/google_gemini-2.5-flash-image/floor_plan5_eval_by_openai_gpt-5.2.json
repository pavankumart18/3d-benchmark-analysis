However, several openings do not align precisely: kitchen entry position appears shifted and/or widened, and multiple interior door swing/orientation choices do not match the 2D plan. Window placement/count is approximated rather than exact (notably in the left sunroom and along some exterior walls). Some proportion drift is visible (kitchen zone and right-side bedroom widths look slightly rebalanced compared to the 2D)."

        "notes": "Primary walls and adjacencies are mostly faithful (no major room swaps). Wall thickness is broadly consistent and doors are generally embedded in walls, but several doors are not placed/hinged as in the plan. The model introduces furniture-driven layout changes (e.g., kitchen island/table) that imply altered circulation clearances vs the 2D. No clearly new rooms are added, but some built-in elements implied by the 2D (continuous kitchen counters/fixtures) are not faithfully represented."

Several room furniture arrangements appear generic rather than mapped (scale/placement deviates from the plan\u2019s intended layouts)."

However, the camera is closer to orthographic top-down than a true isometric, and some elements (doors/windows) appear standardized rather than precisely modeled from the 2D, reducing technical clarity for verification."

        "notes": "Major layout mismatch: Bedroom #4 area in the 2D plan (bottom-center/left of hall, adjacent to covered patio) is not represented as a bedroom in the 3D; that zone appears repurposed into a dining area. Dining room placement also shifts relative to the 2D plan, altering the left/bottom wing organization. Core zones (living/kitchen/master suite/garage) are broadly in the correct regions, but several interior partitions around hall/utility/bedroom wing do not match exactly. Door and window positions are partially consistent but with noticeable count/placement deviations (notably along the top living/master exterior walls). Room proportions for the left/bottom wing are distorted due to the Bedroom #4 vs dining swap."

        "notes": "Adjacency relationships are weakened by the Bedroom #4 omission/repurpose: the 2D requires a bedroom accessed from the hall with a closet and proximity to the lower covered patio; the 3D instead shows an open dining setup, changing intended circulation and function. Several partitions/door openings around hall/utility differ from the plan\u2019s exact geometry. Wall thickness appears generally consistent and doors are mostly embedded in walls, but functional room set fidelity is not maintained due to the missing bedroom."

        "notes": "Living room and kitchen furniture placement is plausible and roughly matches intended usage (seating cluster in living, island/peninsula in kitchen). However, furniture implies a dining function in the location where the 2D plan specifies Bedroom #4, indicating mapping inconsistency. Some furniture scales (notably beds vs room clearances) look only approximately aligned with the 2D dimensions."

However, several openings are represented as plain wall gaps rather than correctly placed/swinging doors, and window placement/segmentation does not cleanly match the 2D (notably the top wall glazing appears merged/extended and the left-side glazing differs from the plan). Minor proportion shifts in some partitions (living room enclosure/central corridor width) compared to the 2D."

Wall thickness is uniform and reasonable, but door embedding is not faithful (missing door leaves/swing arcs; several openings appear as open passages). At least one glazing run is hallucinatorily continuous/extended compared to the discrete windows suggested in the plan. One minor furniture element appears added (coffee table) that is not on the 2D."

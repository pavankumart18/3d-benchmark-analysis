        "notes": "Overall room layout roughly matches (open lounge/dining at left, kitchen central/top, bath+WC central/bottom, two bedrooms right, detached garage). However several openings do not match the 2D plan: the dining-to-hall connection appears as an open passage in 3D where the plan indicates a hinged door; WC door location/orientation appears different (plan shows WC accessed from the hall with a different swing/face than the 3D); laundry/robe partitioning and access looks reinterpreted (3D reads more like an open alcove rather than the plan\u2019s tighter service core). Balcony/glazing length also appears extended relative to the plan\u2019s indicated opening. Room proportion balance (especially living zone vs service core) is somewhat distorted."

        "max": 25,
        "notes": "Primary adjacencies are mostly preserved (kitchen adjacent to living; bath and WC off hall; bedrooms off hall; garage detached). Wall thickness looks consistent and doors are generally embedded in walls. Main structural deviations are in internal opening definitions: missing/changed door at dining-to-hall, WC access/swing mismatch, and altered service-core subdivision (laundry/robe). No clear additional rooms beyond those in the plan; no clear room omissions observed."

        "notes": "The 2D plan provides no furniture layout, yet the 3D includes multiple furniture pieces (sofa set, beds, etc.). Placement/scale cannot be validated against the plan and should be treated as largely invented content for verification purposes; some items also risk misrepresenting circulation widths near doors."

Minor issues: elements read slightly simplified (door leaves/walls), and some openings/glazing proportions look inconsistent with the plan. Overall clarity is good with minimal rendering artifacts."

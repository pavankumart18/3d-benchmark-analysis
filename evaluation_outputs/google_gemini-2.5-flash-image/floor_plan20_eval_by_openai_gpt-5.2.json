        "notes": "Overall room layout and adjacencies largely match the 2D plan (Bedroom-3 left, Living/Dining center, Kitchen/Utility bottom center, Bedrooms 1&2 right, Toilets in same clusters). However, notable proportion/dimension changes are present: Living & Dining is reduced from 23'10\" x 12'11\" to 20'10\" x 12'11\" (E4), and Bedroom-1 changes from 16'5\" x 14'6\" to 13'6\" x 14'8\" (E4). Minor dimension drift also appears (e.g., Utility 4'5\" x 8'7\" to 4'6\" x 8'7\"). Door and window locations appear mostly consistent with the original, with no major relocations detected from the provided images."

        "notes": "No rooms appear missing and no extra rooms are introduced; adjacency relationships (e.g., Kitchen\u2194Living/Dining, Bedroom-2\u2194Toilet-2, Bedroom-1\u2194Toilet-1, Bedroom-3\u2194Toilet-3/4, balconies/deck access) remain consistent. Wall thickness styling differs and some wall/shaft blocks appear visually heavier/darker, which slightly impacts fidelity but does not clearly break the plan. Doors appear embedded plausibly, though exact swing/orientation fidelity cannot be fully verified due to the render being essentially another 2D plan rather than a 3D model."

Scale appears generally consistent, though the proportion changes in Living/Dining and Bedroom-1 imply furniture-to-room scaling may be indirectly distorted relative to the original dimensions."

As a result, isometric camera correctness is not met and orthographic/isometric projection criteria are largely failed. Visual clarity is acceptable and geometry is clean for a 2D plan, but lighting/shading is minimal and not representative of a 3D isometric scene."

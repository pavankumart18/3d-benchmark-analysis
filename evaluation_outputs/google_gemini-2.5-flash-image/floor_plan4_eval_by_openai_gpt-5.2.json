Hall/entry circulation reads narrower/reshaped versus the large hall shown on plan (E4). Interior partition alignment around the hall\u2013closet\u2013bath cluster does not cleanly match the 2D wall breaks (E2). Multiple interior door locations/swing directions are not faithfully represented (several openings appear as doorless voids and/or shifted) (E2/E3). Window/door fenestration does not consistently match the plan\u2014some openings appear enlarged or relocated compared to the 2D window pattern (E2/E5)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness looks mostly consistent, but door embedding is unreliable: several planned hinged doors (bedroom/bath/closet/laundry) are missing as actual door elements or are placed ambiguously (E1/E2). Adjacency relationships are mostly correct (no major room swaps), yet the closet network is not faithfully realized: at least one closet from the plan is unclear/absent or merged into the hall/bath partitioning (E1/E2). No strong evidence of an entirely new room, but at least one exterior opening reads like a full-height door where the plan indicates standard windows (E5)."

Bedroom 2 furniture does not match the plan intent (appears staged as an office with no bed), indicating a missing/incorrect primary furniture element (E1/E2). Furniture scale is broadly plausible, though the altered staging affects perceived room use and proportion."

However, notable proportion drift is present: the Dining room is significantly shortened in the 3D render (2D shows ~15'6\" depth, 3D label shows ~10'6\"), and several room dimension labels differ (e.g., Living and Master Bed dimensions). Some exterior window indicators present in the 2D plan are not consistently represented/legible in the 3D view, making window placement fidelity incomplete."

No clear additional (hallucinated) rooms are introduced. Wall thickness and door embedding appear mostly consistent. The right-side bedroom naming/identity is inconsistent (Bedroom 3 appears to be mislabeled as Bedroom 2 in the 3D), which indicates a mapping error even if the space exists."

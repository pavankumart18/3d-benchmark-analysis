However several openings do not match the 2D plan: multiple doors are missing or left as open wall gaps, and several window runs differ in count/position. Pantry enclosure/entry condition and some room edge proportions (especially pantry/dining edge and right-side exterior wall segmentation) appear distorted vs the plan."

Structural fidelity is reduced by missing/incorrectly embedded doors, and some exterior opening/segment layouts that do not follow the plan precisely. Wall thickness looks generally consistent in the render."

Some items appear arbitrary and may conflict with implied circulation/door locations (where doors are missing in 3D). Furniture scale is generally plausible but not grounded to the annotated 2D layout."

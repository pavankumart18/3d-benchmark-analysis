        "notes": "Living/dining/kitchen are generally located in the correct top half, and bedrooms/bathrooms in the lower half, but several layout specifics deviate: kitchen geometry is changed (peninsula/island-like form vs the plan\u2019s tighter L/galley with defined counter runs), the left-side stepped/notched perimeter and small internal offsets are simplified/shifted, and the hall/entry/door relationships read more open than the plan. Window/door positions do not consistently match the 2D locations, and room proportions (especially living area depth and left wing width) appear distorted compared to the plan."

        "notes": "Primary adjacency is mostly preserved (living adjacent to kitchen/dining; bedrooms off the main hall), but fidelity breaks on exterior features and openings: a balcony/terrace is introduced on the living-room side that is not present in the 2D plan, and several wall offsets and thickness cues from the plan are not maintained. Door embedding/orientation is inconsistent with the plan\u2019s swing placements (notably around the hall/bath/bedroom thresholds), and some closet/utility partitioning appears merged or reinterpreted."

        "notes": "Major furniture beats are plausible (sofa grouping and dining table in the living zone; beds in both bedrooms), but placement does not tightly follow the plan (kitchen work triangle and dining alignment relative to counters/windows differs). Scale is generally consistent, though some circulation clearances look wider than the plan implies."

Lighting is even but flat; geometry is mostly clean with minor softness/low-detail materials. Overall composition is clear, but opening details (doors/windows) are not crisply legible for verification."

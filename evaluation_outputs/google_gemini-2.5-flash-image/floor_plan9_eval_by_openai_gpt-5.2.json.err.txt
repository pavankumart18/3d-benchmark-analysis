    "notes": "Overall footprint and major zone layout (kitchen/living/master/garage) are broadly similar, but several key spatial mappings deviate. Bedroom #4 area appears repurposed/shifted (functions as dining in the 3D), causing downstream adjacency mismatches. Dining room and/or nook placement is not preserved as in the plan. Multiple door locations/swing directions do not reliably match the 2D plan (notably around hall/bedroom cluster and study/dining connection). Window placement/count along major exterior walls (living top wall, right-side bedrooms, and left-side rooms) does not consistently match the 2D plan. Noticeable room proportion drift (hall/utility cluster and garage/adjacent spaces)."

    "notes": "Wall network generally follows the plan’s outer boundary but interior partitions and room functions are not faithfully preserved. Bedroom #4 is effectively missing as a bedroom (space is shown as dining), violating required room set. Adjacency relationships are impacted (dining vs bedroom #4, hall connections). Several doors appear embedded/positioned differently than the plan indicates, and some openings read as added/removed. Potential extra small room/fixture set near the garage entry reads as a hallucinated powder/mud element compared to the unclear/absent labeling in 2D."

    "notes": "Furniture layout does not map cleanly to the labeled 2D functions. A dining table is placed in the area corresponding to Bedroom #4 in the plan (function mismatch). Bedroom furnishings are missing where Bedroom #4 should be. Some items are plausibly scaled, but functional misassignment reduces accuracy."

    "notes": "Render is clean with coherent materials and readable spaces, but camera is not truly isometric (appears more top-down/axonometric with perspective cues). Orthographic/isometric correctness is therefore weak. Lighting is acceptable and geometry is mostly clean, though the presentation obscures exact alignment of windows/doors relative to the 2D plan."

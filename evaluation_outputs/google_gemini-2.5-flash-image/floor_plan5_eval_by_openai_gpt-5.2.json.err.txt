    "notes": "Overall room layout broadly matches (central living/dining, kitchen bottom-left, bedrooms left and right, side bump-outs), but multiple plan-level details diverge. Interior wall lines/offsets are simplified and some openings are not aligned to the 2D plan. Door positions and swings appear inconsistent (several door openings are centered/reshaped versus the plan). Window count/positions do not consistently match the 2D elevations (notably along several exterior walls and wet areas). Room proportions (hall/doorway spacing and some room depths) appear slightly altered."

    "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent and rooms remain generally adjacent as expected (kitchen to living, bedrooms to hall/living). However, several openings are represented with non-plan geometry (rounded/curved portal-like wall shapes) not present in the 2D plan. Some partitions/closet-like separations in the top-central service zone are ambiguous/simplified, and the bathroom/service layout appears to include fixture/room configuration that does not clearly match the plan."

    "notes": "Major furniture types are mapped plausibly (beds in bedrooms, dining in center, seating in living/side rooms), but exact placements don’t strictly follow the 2D symbols (kitchen island/table arrangement and some living seating alignment differ). Scale is generally believable but not plan-faithful in several rooms."

    "notes": "Render is clean with decent lighting and readable room separation. However, it is not a true isometric view (appears more top-down/orthographic-like with shading), and orthographic/isometric consistency is weak. Geometry is mostly clean, but the rounded doorway/wall treatments reduce plan fidelity."

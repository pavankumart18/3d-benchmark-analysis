Kitchen/dining are presented as a simple open plan, but the 2D plan has a clearly bounded dining room with adjacent kitchen/pantry and a distinct window-seat/breakfast condition. Multiple walls/openings shown in plan are missing or relocated, producing incorrect room placement and circulation. Window and door locations do not correspond to the plan and room proportions appear heavily altered (3D appears near-square while the plan is more elongated with specific dimensioned bays)."

Several plan-defined rooms are missing, and several partitions/openings in the 3D appear invented or simplified. Wall thickness is uniform and generic rather than reflecting plan conditions. Doorways are not embedded where the plan indicates (notably around the service core and hall)."

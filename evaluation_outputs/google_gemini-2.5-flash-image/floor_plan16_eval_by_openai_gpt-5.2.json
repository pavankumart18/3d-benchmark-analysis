However, window depiction/placement differs: the Living/Dining left wall window present in the plan is not clearly represented in the render (E1/E2), and the Utility/right-side glazing is rendered as large blue window panels that do not match the plan\u2019s simpler openings (E2). Minor door swing/orientation inconsistencies are visible around Toilet-1/Bedroom entry compared to the plan arcs (E3)."

        "notes": "Adjacency relationships are largely correct (Kitchen-Utility-Toilet stack on right; Bedroom below Toilet; Balcony off Living). No major rooms missing. Notable fidelity issues: wall thickness representation changes substantially (thick black perimeter/interior walls in plan vs thin uniform gray walls in render), which alters perceived structural hierarchy (E4). Door embeddings/leaf thickness and exact jamb positions are simplified, and Toilet/Bedroom door detailing does not consistently match the plan (E2/E3). Render introduces oversized window-wall elements on the right/utility edge beyond what the plan indicates (E5)."

Lighting/shading is minimal and does not convey 3D depth. Geometry is clean and readable, but overall fails the isometric camera requirement and has overly stylized window coloring that reduces plan-faithful clarity."

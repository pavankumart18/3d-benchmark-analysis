        "notes": "Overall room layout and adjacency largely match, but multiple proportional/dimensional inconsistencies are visible between plan and render. Notable size label changes suggest proportion distortion: main DECK changes (25'5\" x 8' in plan vs ~22'6\" x 8' in render) [E4]; BED-1 depth changes (12' x 16'8\" vs 12' x 18'9\") [E4]; TOI-4 label changes (5' x 8' vs 8' x 8') [E4]; FOYER label appears altered (5' x 8'6\" vs 8' x 8'6\") [E4]. Door locations/orientations appear mostly consistent at room entries (BED-2, BED-1, BED-4, toilets, foyer), with no clear major door misplacements detected from the provided resolution. Window placement cannot be reliably verified; openings along the deck/living fa\u00e7ade appear similar but are not distinct enough to score highly."

Adjacency relationships remain consistent (e.g., Kitchen-Utility, Living/Dining central, bedrooms on perimeter). Wall thickness appears consistent within the render, but the render is essentially a re-drawn 2D plan rather than a true 3D translation, limiting verification of door embedding depth and structural details. No hallucinated rooms observed."

Isometric camera correctness is not met, and there is no meaningful 3D geometry to evaluate. Orthographic accuracy is acceptable as a 2D plan, but lighting/shadowing and 3D depth cues are absent. Visual clarity is decent, but it fails the stated 3D isometric requirement."

        "notes": "Overall massing resembles the 2D plan (bedroom top-left, living/dining center-left, kitchen/utility to the right, toilet near top-center/right, balcony bottom-left), but key spatial/entry sequencing is wrong. The foyer shown in plan at the bottom-right is not clearly modeled as a distinct space; the main entry appears to open more directly into the living area. Several door locations/orientations do not match the plan, and some exterior window placements (notably kitchen/utility side) are missing or unclear. Room proportions appear altered (living vs bedroom and right-side service zone widths)."

        "notes": "Walls are generally coherent and consistent in thickness, and major adjacencies (living-to-kitchen, kitchen-to-utility, bedroom-to-living, toilet near corridor) mostly match. However, the foyer as a defined enclosed/partitioned entry zone is effectively absent/merged, and at least one interior doorway/threshold is replaced with an open passage. No extra (hallucinated) rooms are introduced."

Placement is approximate but not faithful to the plan\u2019s indicated layout (e.g., living seating/dining positions and circulation clearances differ). Furniture scale is generally consistent."

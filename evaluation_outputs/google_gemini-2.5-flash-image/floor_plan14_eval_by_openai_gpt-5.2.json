E2/E4: foyer/entry zone appears resized (3D shows different foyer width/labeling vs 2D 4'6\" x 3'8\" + 4'6\" x 4'7\"). E2: several door locations/orientations do not precisely match the 2D (notably around living-to-passage and bath/bedroom door swings). E2/E1: window/opening placement is not faithfully represented\u20142D shows multiple exterior windows and deck openings; 3D largely depicts solid exterior walls with few/no clear window cutouts. E4: deck proportions (especially the large top deck) and some room widths appear visually compressed/expanded relative to the 2D dimensions."

        "notes": "E1/E2: Major structural fidelity loss from missing/unclear exterior fenestration (windows/sliders) that are integral to the 2D plan. E2: door embedding/swing correctness is inconsistent (door locations look approximate rather than exact; some openings appear shifted). Adjacencies are mostly correct (kitchen next to living, utility next to kitchen, toilets near bedrooms/passage), and no obvious extra rooms are added. Wall thickness looks generally consistent, but several boundaries/openings are simplified compared to the 2D."

E2: some furniture placement/orientation does not match the 2D intent (living seating arrangement differs; kitchen/utility fixtures simplified). E4: scale feels slightly off in a few areas (dining set clearance and sofa-to-wall spacing vs the tight 2D proportions)."

        "notes": "Isometric viewpoint is clear and readable, with decent lighting and generally clean geometry. However, E6: lack of modeled windows/openings reduces realism and clarity of the architecture. Orthographic/isometric fidelity is slightly compromised by mild perspective feel and simplified openings. Composition is good but overall architectural legibility is impacted by missing fenestration."

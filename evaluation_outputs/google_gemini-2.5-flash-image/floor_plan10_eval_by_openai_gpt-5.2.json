        "notes": "Room placement is broadly similar (garage bottom-right, living central-right, kitchen/pantry central, theatre left, master suite bottom-left, alfresco top-right). However, several plan-defined recesses/niches are not faithfully modeled: the twin \u201cDESK RECESS\u201d indents between the two top bedrooms are not represented (walls read as simplified/straight). Multiple room dimensions differ from the 2D plan labels (e.g., ACTIVITY length differs; THEATRE depth differs; ALFRESCO length differs), indicating proportion drift. Door placement/orientation cannot be verified accurately because the 3D render largely omits visible door leaves/swing directions, and interior openings are not consistently depicted. Window placement is not represented (no window elements visible along exterior walls), preventing a match to the plan\u2019s window layout."

        "notes": "Primary adjacencies match (kitchen adjacent to pantry/living; bed wing adjacent to activity/bath; master adjacent to ensuite/WIR; entry adjacent to study/garage). Wall thickness is generally consistent. Major fidelity issues: plan-specific recess geometry (desk recesses and some small internal recess/offset conditions) is simplified/absent; door embedding/swing fidelity is not shown, making several door locations effectively missing from the render\u2019s architectural definition. No clear hallucinated rooms were detected, and the main room set appears present."

        "notes": "Furniture is plausible and mostly consistent with room functions (beds in bedrooms, sofa/dining in living, island in kitchen, seating in theatre, outdoor set in alfresco). Some scale/proportion concerns exist (notably theatre seating footprint relative to room depth change; some rooms feel resized vs plan labels), but overall placement is coherent."

        "notes": "The view is primarily top-down/orthographic rather than an isometric 3D render, failing the requested isometric camera expectation. Lighting is flat and uniform with minimal depth cues. Geometry is clean enough, but architectural details (doors/windows) are visually under-defined, reducing clarity for verification. Composition is readable, but not presented as a true isometric."

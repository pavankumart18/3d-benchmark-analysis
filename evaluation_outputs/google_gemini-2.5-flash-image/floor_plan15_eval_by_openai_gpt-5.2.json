In the 3D render, the bottom-right zone that should be the Kitchen is modeled as a room labeled like a bedroom/extra room (E2/E5), and the powder toilet near the entrance is not present (E1). Passage widths and several room proportions differ (render shows wider passages and altered room depths) (E4). Several door positions/swing orientations do not match the 2D plan (notably around the right-side toilet/corridor and the missing powder-toilet door) (E2/E3). Window placement is simplified/partially missing relative to the plan\u2019s exterior openings (E1/E2)."

Powder toilet (P.Toilet) is missing entirely (E1), which also removes its door opening (E1). Some walls/openings appear shifted, creating inconsistent connectivity compared to the plan (E2). Wall thicknesses look visually consistent, but structural fidelity is heavily reduced by missing/misassigned core rooms."

Furniture scale looks generally consistent, but mapping accuracy to the 2D plan is poor due to the incorrect room program on the right side."

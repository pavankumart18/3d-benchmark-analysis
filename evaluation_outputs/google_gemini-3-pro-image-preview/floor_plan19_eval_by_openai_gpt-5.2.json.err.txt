    "notes": "Overall zoning resembles the 2D plan (central living/dining, perimeter bedrooms, kitchen band near bottom), but multiple perimeter shapes and key room connections deviate. The top deck/balcony geometry is altered (render shows a more continuously curved/continuous balcony edge vs the plan’s segmented/angled outline). Several internal wall alignments around the kitchen/utility/toilet cluster do not match the plan’s compartmentalized layout. Door locations are simplified/shifted (many openings shown without matching the plan’s exact positions/swing logic). Window runs are overgeneralized into long glazed bands and do not consistently match the plan’s discrete window/slider placements. Bedroom/bath proportions and corridor widths appear distorted (rendered circulation and some rooms read wider than in plan)."

    "notes": "Wall thickness is rendered mostly uniform, but the plan’s denser wet-area core (multiple small toilets/HO) is not faithfully reproduced—several partitions are missing/merged, changing adjacency relationships. At least one balcony/terrace element appears added where the plan shows none. Bathroom count/layout on the right and lower core appears consolidated, implying missing toilet rooms and incorrect shared/attached relationships (common toilet vs attached toilets)."

    "score": 6,
    "max": 10,
    "notes": "Living/dining furniture roughly matches intent (sofa grouping and dining table), and beds are placed in expected bedroom zones. However, furniture is generic and does not consistently reflect the plan’s exact arrangement (e.g., sofa/chair placement relative to deck openings; wardrobes/side tables simplified). Some furniture scales (notably dining table vs circulation and sofa clearances) look inconsistent with the plan’s tighter core dimensions."

    "notes": "Clean isometric presentation with generally coherent camera angle and readable spaces. Lighting is soft and consistent, with minimal rendering artifacts. However, the render trends toward a stylized/approximate architectural model (long window bands, simplified doors/frames), reducing orthographic/plan-faithful accuracy and visual truthfulness to the source drawing."

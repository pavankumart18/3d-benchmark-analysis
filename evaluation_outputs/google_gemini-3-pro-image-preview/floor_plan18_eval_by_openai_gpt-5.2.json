        "notes": "Overall layout roughly matches (bedroom top-left, living/dining center-left, kitchen right, toilet top-center/right, balcony bottom-left), but several plan-critical deviations exist. The foyer shown in 2D at bottom-right is not clearly formed in 3D (entry appears to open into the living area), altering circulation. Toilet geometry is significantly different (2D is a long 4'9\"x8'0\"; 3D reads much squarer/overwide). Utility zone placement/shape is inconsistent (2D is a defined 3'9\" wide strip connected from kitchen; 3D shows a blue corridor-like area and a small enclosure that do not match the 2D footprint). Window locations do not match well (notably bedroom and living-side openings). Room proportions between living vs. bedroom/bath appear distorted (living seems oversized; bath/utility also enlarged vs plan)."

        "notes": "Key adjacency partly correct (kitchen adjacent to living; toilet near kitchen/living), but the missing/blurred foyer breaks the intended entry sequence and wall segmentation. Door embedding is inconsistent with the 2D plan: the main entry door should land in the foyer, then connect to living and kitchen; 3D lacks that defined enclosure. Utility and service partitions appear reconfigured and include an extra small compartment not indicated on the 2D plan. Wall thickness looks generally consistent, but several partitions are shifted/reshaped compared to the plan."

However, placement/orientation does not tightly follow the 2D layout (e.g., living seating/TV arrangement and circulation differs), and some items read oversized/undersized relative to room sizes due to proportion distortions."

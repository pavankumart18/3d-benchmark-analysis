Living room + kitchen + garage + master suite are roughly in the correct overall zones, but several plan-defined spaces are not represented as distinct rooms (notably Bedroom #4, Study, and the Nook). Wall runs and interior partitions around the central hall/utility/baths do not align to the 2D geometry, and several openings (doors/windows) do not match the plan locations/counts. Room proportions appear altered: the central circulation block and secondary bedroom wing are compressed/reshaped compared to the plan."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent and doors generally appear embedded, but adjacency fidelity is weakened by missing rooms and altered partitioning. The plan\u2019s defined program (4 bedrooms + study + nook) is not faithfully preserved. Some internal partitions/closet-like nooks appear added or reshaped relative to the 2D plan, indicating hallucinated/incorrect subdivisions."

Kitchen cabinetry/peninsula shape and placement do not match the plan\u2019s angled counter/sink/DW configuration. Scales look plausible, but several rooms lack plan-consistent furnishing layouts."

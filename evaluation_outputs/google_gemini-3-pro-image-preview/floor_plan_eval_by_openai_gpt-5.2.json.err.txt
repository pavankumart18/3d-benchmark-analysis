    "notes": "Living/dining/kitchen zone is broadly in the correct top half, and both bedrooms are in the lower left/right as in plan. However, the bottom-center \"DEN\" enclosure shown in the 2D plan is not represented as a distinct room in the 3D (reads as open hall/circulation). Left-side service zone is reinterpreted: the 3D shows a separated small sink/vanity room adjacent to the left bathroom that does not match the 2D room breakdown. Several openings (notably the right-side door from living room toward Chandler/Joey side) are not clearly placed/expressed where the 2D indicates. Window distribution beyond the bay window is not preserved; bedroom windows shown on the 2D plan are not evident in the 3D. Overall proportions appear shifted: the central circulation/closet band and den area are enlarged/loosened relative to the tighter 2D partitioning."

    "notes": "Wall layout does not faithfully reproduce the 2D partitioning: the den room is missing as an enclosed volume and the left coat/adjacent spaces are reconfigured. Adjacencies are partially preserved (kitchen adjacent to dining/living; bedrooms separated by central bath/closets), but the left-side bathroom/coat/closet relationships do not match the 2D. Multiple doors are missing or not embedded/oriented per the plan (key interior doors and the right-side living-room door). Several plan-indicated windows (bedrooms) are missing. A hallucinated separate vanity/sink room appears on the left, not clearly supported by the 2D labeling/compartmentalization."

    "notes": "Major furniture types are present in expected zones (dining table near kitchen, living seating group, beds in both bedrooms), but details diverge from the 2D: kitchen fixture/appliance layout is simplified and does not match the drawn counters/placements; some pieces appear rescaled (living seating group vs room size) and several plan-specific elements (e.g., smaller fixtures in closets/den areas) are omitted."

    "notes": "Render is clean and readable with good lighting and generally consistent materials. Camera is near-isometric but still shows mild perspective rather than strict orthographic. Geometry is mostly clean; however, some wall/door articulations are ambiguous, reducing clarity for verification (openings not clearly modeled where required). Composition and overall visual quality are strong despite fidelity issues."

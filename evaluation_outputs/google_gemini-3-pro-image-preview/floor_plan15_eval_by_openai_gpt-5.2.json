(E1/E2) The living/dining balcony shown at the top-center of the 2D plan is not modeled as a balcony with an exterior opening; the 3D shows a flat exterior wall with windows instead. (E2/E3) Bathroom placements and their door orientations do not cleanly match the 2D: at least one toilet that should open off the wide passage/living zone appears shifted and/or reoriented. (E4) Corridor widths and room proportions (especially the central living/dining vs. adjacent passages) look altered, with the circulation areas appearing wider and the living/dining zone compressed relative to the 2D. (E2) Window groupings on the long exterior walls do not match the exact plan locations (bedroom windows appear redistributed)."

        "notes": "Major structural elements are simplified and some are incorrect. (E1) Missing the primary living/dining balcony volume and its bounding rail/parapet as indicated in the 2D. (E2) Several interior walls (notably around passages/toilets) are not aligned to the 2D wall runs, indicating adjacency drift between toilets/bedrooms and the living core. (E4) Wall thicknesses appear visually uniform in 3D but do not reflect the 2D plan\u2019s varied structural/shaft thicknesses and offset columns/cores (render omits/softens these). (E2/E3) Door embedding and swing/orientation do not consistently correspond to the 2D door positions (some openings appear centered/relocated on walls rather than at the plan-indicated ends). (E5) Added interior partitions/closet-like niches appear that are not clearly present in the 2D drawing."

(E2) Living/dining furniture arrangement does not clearly correspond to the plan\u2019s living seating + dining placement relative to the balcony opening (since the balcony/door is missing, the furniture zoning shifts). (E4) Some furniture appears slightly oversized for the modeled room proportions, especially dining clearance and bed-to-wall spacing."

Lighting is serviceable but flat, reducing depth cues for openings. Projection is mostly consistent, though some perspective feel suggests it is not a strict orthographic/isometric."

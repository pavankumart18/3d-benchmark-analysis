        "notes": "Overall arrangement roughly follows the plan (bedroom zone at top, central kitchen/living, alfresco to the right, master/study/front zone at bottom), but multiple critical spatial mismatches exist. (1) Garage massing is substantially larger than the plan and reads as a double-bay rather than the single garage shown (E4/E5), affecting adjacent entry proportions. (2) Front external areas (verandah/portico) are not clearly separated/positioned as in the plan (E1/E2). (3) Several small-service spaces shown in plan (WIL/linen/recesses) are not consistently represented as distinct volumes, altering corridor/room geometry (E1/E4). (4) Door and window layouts do not reliably match the 2D openings, especially along the front and bedroom fa\u00e7ades (E2/E3)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is generally consistent in the render, but fidelity to the plan\u2019s structural partitioning is weak in key areas. Adjacency is only partially correct: living-to-alfresco connection exists, and bedroom cluster exists, but entry/garage/study/front-zone relationships are distorted by the enlarged garage and unclear portico/verandah definition (E2/E4). Multiple plan-defined micro-spaces (WIL, linen, recesses) are missing or merged (E1). The garage depiction introduces an extra bay/space not present in the plan (E5). Several interior door embeddings/openings appear simplified compared to the plan\u2019s door count and swing placements (E2/E3)."

        "notes": "Furniture is plausible but does not map tightly to the plan\u2019s intent. The plan indicates a dedicated theatre; the render shows lounge seating, but the theatre fit-out/placement is ambiguous and may be substituted by generic living seating (E2). Bedroom furnishing is generic and may not match window/robe/desk-recess constraints shown on plan (E2/E4). Scale is mostly consistent, but the oversized garage and some open areas make furniture-to-room scale unreliable in affected zones (E4)."

Materials are consistent and there are no major rendering artifacts. Visual clarity is good; however, some geometry simplification (missing recesses/closets and simplified openings) reduces architectural legibility relative to the plan."

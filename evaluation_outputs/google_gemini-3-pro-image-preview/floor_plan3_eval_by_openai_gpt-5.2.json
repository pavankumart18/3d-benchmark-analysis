Bathroom door position/orientation is wrong, the dining-side top opening is not represented as in plan, and several window locations/counts differ. Bathroom and stair areas appear scaled differently than the 2D proportions."

        "notes": "Adjacency is mostly preserved (open kitchen/dining/living; bath central; stair left), but the opening layout deviates: a required exterior door on the left wall of the kitchen is missing, and the bathroom entry relationship to the main space is incorrect due to door relocation. Several window/door elements appear substituted (door vs window) relative to the plan. No extra enclosed rooms are added, but multiple elements are effectively hallucinated/substituted as different opening types."

However, the scene reads more like a generic interior than a precise architectural translation (opening substitutions and scale feel reduce technical clarity/faithfulness)."

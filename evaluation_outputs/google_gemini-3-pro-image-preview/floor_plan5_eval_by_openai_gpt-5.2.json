Room sizes appear distorted (left bedroom and left outdoor room appear oversized relative to the central area; some right-side rooms read compressed) (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent and clean, but structural fidelity deviates in the top-center core where extra/misaligned partitions read as additional closet/bath segmentation not evidenced in the 2D plan (E5/E2). Door embedding is inconsistent: several openings lack door leaves and do not match the plan\u2019s door placements (E6/E2). Key adjacencies mostly hold (bedrooms remain on correct sides, kitchen connects to living zone), but the bathroom/utility adjacency relationships at the top band are not faithfully reproduced (E2). No major primary room appears fully omitted, but the plan\u2019s fenestration scheme is not preserved (E1)."

Furniture scale is broadly plausible and consistent, with no extreme sizing issues detected."

However, fidelity-related rendering choices reduce technical clarity: several doorways appear as open voids without modeled doors, and window cutouts are inconsistent with the plan (E6). Composition and readability are good overall."

Doors are frequently misplaced or incorrectly oriented, for example, the main entrance door and the door to Monica's bedroom. Window placement is generally preserved, but the large living room window has distorted proportions. Room proportions are not perfectly preserved, especially in the bathrooms and the kitchen area, leading to a cramped appearance in some sections."

Door embedding is incorrect for almost all doors; they are often recessed or not properly integrated into the wall. Adjacency relationships are mostly correct, but the hallway leading to the bedrooms and bathrooms appears narrower. No missing rooms are detected, but some areas, like the closet near the main entrance, are greatly simplified. No hallucinated rooms are present."

For example, the dining table is shifted, the couch near the window is scaled incorrectly, and bedroom furniture layouts are significantly altered. Furniture scale consistency is an issue, with some items appearing oversized or undersized relative to the room."

The geometry is generally clean with few major distortions, but some surfaces appear unnaturally flat. Visual clarity is good, but the composition feels a bit sterile due to the flat lighting and simplified textures."

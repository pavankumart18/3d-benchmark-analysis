However, the Alcove and Breakfast Nook areas are significantly distorted or missing. Wall alignment has numerous inaccuracies, particularly in the Central Hall, WC, and the area near the stairs. Door placements are frequently incorrect, with missing doors and incorrect orientations. Window placements are also incorrect, with many windows missing or mispositioned. Room proportions are distorted throughout the model."

Adjacency relationships are frequently compromised by incorrect wall placements and missing elements. There are missing rooms (e.g., Alcove is not represented as a distinct space, Breakfast is incomplete). There are no significantly hallucinated rooms, but existing rooms are improperly structured."

Some elements that are present, like kitchen cabinets and appliances, are placed approximately but not precisely. Furniture scale consistency is difficult to assess accurately due to general proportion issues, but some elements like the washer/dryer appear reasonable."

However: Toilet area is reconfigured into two spaces in the 3D (toilet room + separate shower cubicle) vs single Toilet-1 in plan (E2/E5). Bedroom entry/door location appears shifted and/or left as an open passage without the shown swing placement from the plan (E2/E3). Window placement does not match: 3D adds a long multi-panel bedroom window along the bottom exterior wall not clearly indicated in the plan, and omits/does not clearly represent expected openings on other exterior walls (living/kitchen/utility) (E2/E5). Some proportion drift: toilet/utility zone depth and partitions look different from plan dimensions (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall network broadly follows the plan footprint, but internal partitioning in the bath/shaft zone deviates: an extra enclosed shower-like room is introduced to the right of Toilet-1 (E5) and the right-side dashed-zone in plan (likely shaft/wardrobe) is not represented consistently (E2). Door embedding is inconsistent: multiple openings are modeled without door leaves/swings where the 2D specifies hinged doors (entry/toilet/bedroom) (E2/E6). Adjacencies mostly correct (kitchen-utility, living-balcony, living-bedroom), but bath subdivision changes functional adjacency and circulation (E2). No major missing primary rooms detected (living, kitchen, utility, toilet, bedroom, balcony all present)."

Some items differ from plan intent: added desk/workstation and additional cabinetry not indicated, and balcony furniture layout differs from the simple balcony depiction (E5/E2). Scale is mostly believable but some built-ins (wardrobe/cabinet runs) appear exaggerated compared to the plan\u2019s implied clearances (E4)."

Minor issues: door representations are inconsistent/absent (reads as incomplete modeling rather than design intent) (E6), and some wall/partition thicknesses appear uneven in the bath/utility cluster (E4)."

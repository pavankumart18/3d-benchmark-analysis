        "notes": "Overall layout roughly matches (open lounge/dining left, kitchen central-top, two bedrooms right, bath+WC central-bottom, separate garage). However several plan-to-render mismatches are evident: the entry/linen zone is not clearly modeled as a distinct closet; the hall/door cluster near bath/WC is reconfigured with different door positions and swing/orientation; the robe/wardrobe location does not match the plan (render shows a long built-in along the corridor/bedroom side rather than the small RO BE location shown near the kitchen/bedroom junction). Window placement also deviates (render adds/reshapes openings on external walls compared to the plan\u2019s limited, specific openings). Minor-to-moderate proportion drift in corridor width and wet-area sizing."

        "notes": "Key adjacencies are mostly correct (kitchen adjacent to living; bath and WC near corridor; bedrooms grouped). But fidelity issues remain: the linen closet at entry appears missing/merged; robe placement is inconsistent; door embedding/orientation around the bath/WC/bedroom hall does not follow the 2D plan exactly; exterior openings do not consistently match the plan. No clearly new room is invented, but storage elements appear hallucinated/relocated."

Kitchen/bath fixtures are present but not clearly matching the 2D intent (wet-area fittings and storage/robe placement). Some furniture scaling/proportion is acceptable, but not verifiably aligned to the given room dimensions."

Minor issues: openings/door panels look inconsistent in thickness and placement; some areas feel simplified/ambiguous (closets/wet-area details).

(E2/E3) Several door locations and swing/orientation cues from the plan are not faithfully reproduced (bedroom entries, bath/WC access, balcony access). (E2) Window placements along exterior walls do not align with the plan; openings are missing or relocated.

(E1) Balcony (and its balustrade / outdoor boundary condition) is effectively missing as a distinct exterior element. (E2) Adjacency relationships are partially preserved (3 bedrooms on right, service core near center), but the corridor/entry relationships differ from the 2D plan. (E1/E2) Built-ins shown in plan (LINEN, ROBE placements) are missing or not modeled where indicated. (E2) Door embedding is inconsistent\u2014several planned doors appear as open wall gaps or are shifted, changing privacy and circulation."

(E5) The left-side 'Activity' room is furnished/treated like a living room, and the balcony area furniture appears interiorized, conflicting with the plan\u2019s outdoor balcony intent. Furniture scale is broadly plausible, but placement does not respect the plan\u2019s room functions and boundaries."

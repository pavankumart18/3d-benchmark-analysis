Wall alignment is mostly accurate with some minor discrepancies, especially around the Kitchen/Utility/SR area. Door placements are generally good, but some orientations are incorrect (e.g., service room, Bedroom 3 bathroom). Window placements are largely missing. Room proportions are significantly distorted in several areas, particularly the utility, service room, and the balcony off the master bedroom."

Door embedding is inconsistent, with some doors appearing to float or having gaps. Adjacency relationships are mostly correct, but the proportional distortions impact the perception of these. There are no missing rooms, but significant proportional changes make some rooms almost unrecognizable. No hallucinated rooms."

Geometry is mostly clean with some minor distortions visible, particularly where walls meet the floor or ceiling plane. Visual clarity and composition are good, but the lack of windows and exterior wall details reduces realism."

        "notes": "Overall layout resembles a 2-bed unit with central living and two balconies, but multiple plan-level mismatches are present. (E2) Foyer/entry sequence at bottom-right of 2D plan is not clearly formed in 3D (entry reads as a large open cut-out rather than a defined 4'6\"x3'8\" foyer + short passage). (E2/E4) Living/Dining (15'x21'4\") appears compressed and more square in 3D; circulation widths and room aspect ratios do not match the long central hall-like proportion shown in 2D. (E2) Kitchen placement is generally correct (bottom-left), but its enclosure/opening lines differ from 2D (missing/shifted partial walls). (E3/E2) Several door orientations/hinge locations do not match the 2D swings; some openings are rendered as cased openings without clear door leaves where the plan shows doors. (E2) Window/slider placement to balconies and external walls does not consistently match the 2D window runs (notably along living-to-deck and bedroom exterior walls)."

        "notes": "Key adjacencies mostly exist (living center, bedrooms on left/right, toilets near bedrooms, utility near kitchen), but plan fidelity is weak. (E1) The foyer as a distinct bounded space is effectively missing/merged into a large void/opening. (E2) Bathroom blocks are not clearly located/partitioned exactly as in 2D (common toilet vs TOI-1 arrangement/door access reads differently). (E2) Several interior partitions (around entry and living) do not align with 2D wall lines, indicating wall alignment errors. (E6) Door embedding is inconsistent (some planned doors appear absent or rendered as open passages). No clearly hallucinated additional rooms, but partitions/furnishings create implied zones not present in 2D."

Kitchen cabinetry/appliance linework is simplified and does not match the exact 2D counter runs."

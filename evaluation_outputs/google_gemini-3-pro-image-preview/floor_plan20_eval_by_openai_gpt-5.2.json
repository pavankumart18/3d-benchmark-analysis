        "notes": "Overall room zoning is similar (Bedroom-3 left, Living/Dining center, Kitchen/Utility lower center, Bedroom-2 upper right, Bedroom-1 lower right), but major outdoor spaces are not spatially represented correctly. The long DECK along the top edge of Living/Dining is not modeled as an exterior deck space (appears as interior wall/window band instead) (E1/E2). Both balconies (Bedroom-2 top balcony and Bedroom-1 right balcony) are not clearly/accurately modeled as accessible exterior rooms with correct footprint (E1/E2). Window distribution along the top facade is rendered as a continuous ribbon that does not match the discrete openings suggested by the plan (E2). Some room proportions (especially the depth/width relationship of Living/Dining vs. the missing deck band) are distorted due to the deck omission (E4)."

        "notes": "Primary adjacencies mostly hold (Bedroom-3 adjacent to two toilets; Kitchen adjacent to Utility; Toilet-1 near Bedroom-1; Toilet-2 near Bedroom-2). However, structural fidelity is heavily penalized for missing exterior spaces: DECK is missing as a defined bounded room/area (E1), and both balconies are not faithfully constructed (E1/E2). Door embedding and swings are not reliably consistent with the plan (several doors appear simplified and some openings appear shifted relative to the corridor linework) (E2/E3). No clear hallucinated new rooms, but exterior elements are effectively replaced by interior glazing/wall strips (E2/E5 depending on interpretation)."

        "notes": "Furniture is only loosely mapped. Bedroom-2 shows two single beds in the 3D render whereas the 2D plan depicts a single larger bed arrangement (E2/E4). Living/Dining furniture is broadly in the correct zone but not aligned to the plan\u2019s arrangement, and kitchen layout appears simplified/changed (E2). Scale feels generally plausible, but several pieces (beds/sofa group) do not match the plan\u2019s implied placement."

However, it is not orthographic-accurate to the plan (not a true top-down match), and the facade/window treatment looks generalized (E2). Overall visual quality is good, but architectural fidelity issues reduce functional clarity."

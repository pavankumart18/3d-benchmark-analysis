Door locations and swing/orientation are not faithfully represented (many openings are generalized). Window placement from the 2D plan is largely absent/undefined in the 3D render (balcony openings exist, but typical exterior windows are not mapped). Some room proportions and circulation widths (hall/corridor and dining-to-bedroom distribution) appear simplified versus the 2D layout."

        "notes": "Primary adjacencies mostly hold (kitchen-utility, living-balcony, master-dress/baths, bedroom cluster to right). However, structural openings/doors are not embedded per plan (missing clear door frames and exact positions). There appears to be an added exterior terrace/balcony-like space at the bottom that does not clearly correspond to the 2D plan (utility is shown in 2D, but the rendered outdoor treatment/extent looks expanded). Wall thickness looks generally consistent, but several partitions are simplified compared to the 2D plan\u2019s tighter bathroom/closet segmentation."

Bedroom furniture is generally plausible but not tightly matched to the 2D plan (some seating/side tables and bed clearances differ). Furniture scale is mostly consistent, though some rooms read slightly under/over-furnished relative to the plan."

        "notes": "Render is visually clean with readable room separation and decent lighting. However, the camera is closer to a top-down/axonometric view than a true isometric presentation, and orthographic accuracy is weakened by soft perspective/blur. Geometry is mostly clean, but the lack of explicit windows/door detailing reduces clarity as an architectural verification render."

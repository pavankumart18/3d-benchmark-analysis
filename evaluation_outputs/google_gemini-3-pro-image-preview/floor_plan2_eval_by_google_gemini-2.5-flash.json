Wall alignment for the exterior is generally good, but interior walls show discrepancies, especially around the bathroom and the front-left bedroom. Door placement and orientation are incorrect for several doors; the bathroom door opens incorrectly, the bedroom door on the right is missing, and the front-left bedroom door is both misplaced and has incorrect swing. Window placement is generally missing in the render."

Adjacency relationships are broadly maintained but distorted by room proportion changes. One room (the small one next to the kitchen with a table) is missing a door entrance from the main living area. The render also introduces an additional wall/structure in the kitchen area adjacent to the dining table."

In the front-left bedroom, the beds are placed differently, and a significant amount of furniture from the floor plan (e.g., wardrobe, drawers) is missing. The living room furniture is arranged differently. The kitchen appliances are not accurately mapped; the washer/dryer are missing, and the sink area is simplified. The bathroom also has simplified and misplaced fixtures. Scale consistency for furniture is questionable given the room proportion distortions."

        "notes": "Major layout mismatch between 2D and 3D. The 2D plan shows a clearly defined CENTRAL HALL (left), a WC near the top center, a UTILITY ROOM/HVAC core near center, KITCHEN+PANTRY at top-right, and a large DINING ROOM with a labeled WINDOW SEAT bay on the right. In the 3D render, the circulation core and room boundaries do not align: the stair/hall arrangement is different, the central service block is reorganized, and the dining room perimeter (including the bay/window-seat zone) is not faithfully reproduced. Door locations are mostly represented as generic openings without matching the 2D door positions/swings. Exterior window openings do not correspond to the plan\u2019s indicated window/feature locations (notably around the dining/window-seat wall). Room proportions (kitchen vs dining vs hall widths) appear substantially altered."

        "notes": "Adjacency relationships are not preserved: in 2D the WC/utility/HVAC cluster sits between hall and kitchen/dining, while the 3D shows a different grouping/partitioning that reads like additional bath/service spaces. Several walls in 3D do not match the 2D wall runs (especially around the core near the stairs and the right-side angled/bay area). Multiple openings are not embedded where the 2D indicates doors (loss of door-specific placement and swing). At least one space on the right is modeled as a large attached room/porch volume that does not read as the correctly bounded BREAKFAST(SCREENED)/deck condition shown on plan (scale and connection differ). Overall, both missing and hallucinated partitions are present."

Cabinet/appliance scale appears plausible, but their exact alignment to the 2D kitchen layout (including pantry boundary) is not clearly faithful."

        "notes": "Camera isometric view is acceptable and the model is generally clean. However, openings read inconsistent (some look like missing doors rather than modeled doors), and several wall junctions/returns look simplified versus plan complexity (notably around the angled/bay facade). Lighting is flat but serviceable; geometry is mostly clean with minor visual ambiguity in small-room partitions."

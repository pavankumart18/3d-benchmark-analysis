Door locations and circulation paths appear simplified/shifted vs the plan (E2/E3). Window/slider placements along the deck edge are generalized rather than matching the plan\u2019s openings (E2). Room proportion relationships (living vs bedrooms vs kitchen depth) are not preserved (E4)."

Bathroom placements appear altered (some read as attached where the plan shows common access, and vice-versa) (E2/E3). A non-plan exterior element at bottom-right indicates hallucination (E5)."

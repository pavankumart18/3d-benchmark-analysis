    "notes": "Overall layout resembles a 2-bed + central living core, but several key spaces do not match the 2D plan. The laundry/closet block at the lower-left of the plan is not clearly present as a distinct room in the 3D. Circulation is rendered as a long corridor rather than the broader hall shown. Multiple interior wall runs (especially around hall/bath/closets) appear shifted, changing room shapes. Door positions and swing/orientation are frequently inconsistent with the plan. Window count/size on exterior walls appears generalized rather than matching the plan’s specific window pattern."

    "notes": "Wall thickness looks mostly consistent and geometry is clean, but several plan-defined partitions (laundry + two closets near hall/laundry area) are not faithfully reproduced. Adjacencies are partially correct (living near kitchen/dining; bedrooms on the right), yet the hall-to-bath/closet configuration differs. Some doors appear as simplified openings or are placed differently than in the 2D. No clear additional 'extra' rooms beyond the plan, but there are notable element insertions (e.g., large glazed opening) not supported by the 2D drawing."

    "notes": "Major furniture zones broadly correspond (dining table in kitchen/dining, sofa/TV in living, bed in primary bedroom, desk in secondary bedroom). However, several items are arranged to fit the altered wall layout and do not match the 2D’s fixture placements (notably kitchen/bath/laundry-related built-ins). Furniture scale is generally consistent."

    "notes": "Isometric presentation is strong with clean materials, readable spaces, and good lighting. However, the render uses simplified/idealized openings and proportions that reduce orthographic faithfulness to the plan. Minor issues include overly uniform window modules and some ambiguous door/opening representation."

Living-room enclosure/partitioning does not match the 2D plan (wall runs/openings differ) (E2). Multiple door locations/openings are simplified or shifted vs the plan (E2/E3). All plan-indicated windows are absent in the 3D (E1). Corridor and central open area feel widened relative to the plan, affecting room proportions (E4)."

Adjacency is mostly correct (bath/office between bedrooms, living near kitchen), but the living-room boundary wall alignment/opening logic diverges from the plan (E2). No clear missing rooms, but multiple required openings/doors and all windows are missing (E1). A few added decorative elements (plants) not present on plan count as minor hallucinations (E5)."

Living room furniture arrangement differs from the plan\u2019s depicted layout (E2). Scale is generally plausible, though some pieces (cabinetry/wardrobe) appear oversized relative to room width (E4)."

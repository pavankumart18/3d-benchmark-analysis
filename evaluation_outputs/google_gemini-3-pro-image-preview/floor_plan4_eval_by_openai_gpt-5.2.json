The kitchen/dining area footprint is expanded/shifted compared to the plan, breaking the intended room zoning (E2). Hall/circulation geometry is altered with extra/angled partitions not present in the plan (E5) and several openings/door locations do not match the plan\u2019s wall breaks (E2/E3). Window distribution on the right/top facades does not follow the plan\u2019s specific placements/counts (E2). Room proportions (notably hall vs. service rooms) appear distorted relative to labeled areas (E4)."

Additional small rooms/closet-like partitions near the entry/hall are introduced (E5). Door embedding/locations are inconsistent with the plan (multiple interior doors appear repositioned) (E2/E3). Wall thickness looks broadly consistent but the internal partitioning does not match the 2D wall layout (E2)."

However, because the kitchen/service-room locations are incorrect, furniture/appliance mapping to the correct rooms is unreliable (E2). Several items appear generic/hallucinated (e.g., oversized wardrobe blocks and living glazing context) and scale feels inconsistent in the tight service-core areas (E5/E4)."

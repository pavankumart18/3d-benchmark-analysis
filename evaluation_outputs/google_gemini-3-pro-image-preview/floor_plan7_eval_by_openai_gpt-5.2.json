The 2D plan shows a distinct 'Entrance to the House' vestibule with double doors at the top-right; the 3D render does not show this entry space/door and instead presents a long enclosed right-side zone (E1, E5). Wet areas: the 2D plan has a separate Wash Area and Toilet; the 3D render appears to combine/alter these into a single bathroom-like room and the partitioning/placement does not match (E1, E2). Door placement/orientation is not faithfully represented: several plan doors (bedroom, wash, toilet, entrance) are missing or replaced by generic openings without correct positions (E2, E3). Window placements/counts do not consistently match the plan (notably along the living/right exterior and bedroom edges) (E2). Overall proportions deviate, especially around stairs/right wing and kitchen-dining relationship (E4)."

However, key structural program fidelity is broken: the Entrance vestibule/door is missing (E1) and the Wash Area is not represented as a separate room from the Toilet (E1). Adjacency relationships are altered around the core (wash/toilet/hall) and the right-side zone near the stairs (E2). A large additional enclosed space on the far right is not clearly present in the 2D plan as a separate room and reads as a hallucinated room/volume rather than the labeled stair zone (E5). Doors are not embedded/placed per plan; several are absent entirely (E2, E3)."

Kitchen counter geometry differs from the plan\u2019s U-shaped arrangement (E2). Furniture scale is generally consistent and believable."

Lighting is clean and even; materials are consistent. Geometry is generally clean with no major visible mesh distortions; openings are crisp, though the lack of door elements reduces architectural clarity (E6/minor)."

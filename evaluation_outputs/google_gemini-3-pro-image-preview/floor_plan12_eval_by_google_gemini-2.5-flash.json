Adjacency relationships are frequently incorrect due to missing or misplaced walls/doors. The 'Balcony' room is effectively missing as a distinct outdoor space, and the 'Recess' area is completely missing. No hallucinated rooms, but significant structural alterations to existing areas."

The geometry is mostly clean, but some wall junctions show minor distortions. Visual clarity is good, but the composition could be improved with more consistent lighting and shadow distribution across the entire floor plan."

E2/E3: Several interior doors do not match the 2D plan in position and/or swing/orientation (notably around the entry hall/den area and bathroom/bedroom connections). E2: The top-left closet zone adjacent to the living room/kitchen is not faithfully formed (render shows an open alcove/plant area rather than a clearly enclosed closet with a door). E4: Corridor and room proportions appear altered (entry/den band and central bath area look widened/reshaped vs plan), impacting adjacency geometry and perceived room sizes. E2: Right-side living-room wall opening/door location does not clearly align with the 2D plan's indicated doorway toward the neighboring apartment."

        "notes": "E2/E4: Wall segments and offsets on the left side (bath/coat/hall zone) do not strictly follow the stepped wall geometry shown in the 2D plan; some partitions are simplified or shifted. E1/E2: Closet/coat storage elements are not consistently enclosed or doored as in plan (top-left closet and left-side coat area). E2/E3: Door embedding and adjacency logic is inconsistent in places (some openings appear centered/relocated, and some door swings are not represented). No clear evidence of additional fully hallucinated rooms, but multiple structural elements are simplified or misrepresented."

Kitchen reads as an L-shape with similar appliance placement, but exact fixture positions are approximate. E4: Some furniture appears slightly rescaled relative to room sizes (e.g., living seating cluster and bedroom clearances), consistent with the proportion changes in the shell."

        "notes": "Isometric camera is coherent and readable, with good overall composition and soft lighting. Orthographic/isometric correctness is acceptable (minor perspective feel but not severe). Geometry is mostly clean; however, some edges/openings read simplified and slightly imprecise compared to the crisp 2D plan. Visual clarity is good, but plan-faithful detailing (doors/windows) is under-modeled."

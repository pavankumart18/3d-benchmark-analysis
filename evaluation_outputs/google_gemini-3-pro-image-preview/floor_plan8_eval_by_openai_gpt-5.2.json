Dining-room bump-out geometry and exterior opening treatment differ (E4/E2). Pantry enclosure/entry appears reconfigured relative to the 2D plan (E2). Multiple door swings/placements do not match the plan (notably around the kitchen/dining connection and some interior openings) (E2/E3). Window counts/positions on the right-side kitchen/playroom perimeter and along the bottom dining fa\u00e7ade do not reliably match the 2D window layout (E2). Proportions of the kitchen footprint vs. dining/playroom appear altered (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness looks mostly consistent, but several structural relationships are altered: the pantry is not faithfully enclosed/entered as in plan (E2) and the dining-room fa\u00e7ade/bay is substantially different (E4). Adjacencies are mostly preserved (kitchen-to-playroom, kitchen-to-dining, foyer-to-living), but internal opening definitions differ (E2/E3). At least one exterior opening at the dining bump-out appears added/changed compared to the 2D plan (E5/E2). No obvious entire major room is missing, but several elements are materially reinterpreted."

The 2D plan provides limited furniture intent, while the 3D adds extensive living/playroom furnishings that cannot be verified and may not align with circulation clearances (E5). Some furniture scale (large living seating group vs. room) appears tight compared to the 2D proportions (E4)."

Minor issues: some openings/windows read inconsistently (visual alignment/spacing) and a few door panels look awkwardly placed relative to wall returns (E6). Lighting is flat but acceptable; composition is clear."

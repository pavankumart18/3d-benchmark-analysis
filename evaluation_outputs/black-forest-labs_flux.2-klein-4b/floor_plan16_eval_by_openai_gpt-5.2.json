        "notes": "Overall layout roughly matches (living/dining left, kitchen top, utility top-right, toilet mid-right, bedroom bottom-right), but key spatial details diverge. The right-side service/duct area is greatly enlarged in the 3D compared to the narrow shaft shown on the plan (major boundary/proportion mismatch). Several doors/openings are missing or not expressed (main entry, toilet entry, balcony access), making circulation inaccurate. Window/opening positions are not reliably represented."

        "notes": "Wall massing is mostly coherent and thickness looks reasonably consistent, but door embedding is largely incorrect/absent. Adjacencies are partially preserved (kitchen adjacent to living, utility adjacent to kitchen, toilet near bedroom), yet the oversized/open right-side void changes the intended enclosure and exterior boundary. No major labeled room is entirely omitted, but an extra/expanded exterior/void space is introduced beyond the 2D plan."

However, the render simplifies openings and details (doors/windows), reducing architectural clarity, and the large right-side opening/void harms perceived correctness."

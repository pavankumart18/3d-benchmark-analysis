        "notes": "Major wall-layout mismatch vs the 2D plan: the original is predominantly orthogonal with a simple rectangular footprint + small entry recess, while the 3D model introduces multiple angled/diagonal wall segments and a distorted perimeter (E4/E2). The hall/corridor geometry is significantly different, affecting room placement and circulation (E2). Bathroom enclosure/placement reads incorrect: the large oval tub-like element appears in/too close to the corridor rather than clearly inside the bathroom volume shown on the plan (E2). Several door positions and swing/orientation do not match the plan\u2019s door locations along the hall/corridor (E2/E3). Window count/placement along the long top wall and right wall does not clearly align with the plan\u2019s window locations and spacing (E2). Room proportions (living vs hall vs bathroom) appear distorted relative to labeled areas (E4)."

Adjacency relationships are partially preserved (kitchen/dining connected to living; bedrooms on right), but the hall/bath/closet cluster is not faithfully reproduced (E2). At least one closet is not clearly present as a discrete enclosed room/volume as in the plan (laundry-side closet and/or the small central closet are ambiguous/missing) (E1). The apparent exposed tub/fixture in the corridor constitutes an element that does not match the plan\u2019s enclosed bathroom layout (E5/E2)."

Some furniture scales (e.g., oversized tub-like element relative to corridor width) appear inconsistent (E4)."

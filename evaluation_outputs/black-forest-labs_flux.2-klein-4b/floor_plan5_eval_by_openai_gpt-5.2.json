The 2D plan is predominantly rectilinear with clear rectangular rooms and a central living/dining zone; the 3D render shows a largely irregular/polygonal outline with multiple curved/angled interior partitions. Major room placement mismatch: the kitchen zone shown in the 2D (bottom-left with counters/island) is not represented in the same location or configuration; the central dining table area in the 2D is not mapped as a dining space in the 3D. Doors and windows are not placed according to the plan, and room proportions/relationships are heavily distorted."

Several openings appear as wide portal gaps rather than door leaves consistent with the plan\u2019s hinged doors. Multiple rooms from the 2D layout (kitchen, defined dining area, specific bathroom/closet partitions) are missing or merged, and there appear to be extra/altered partitioned niches not present in the plan."

Scale/spacing is inconsistent with the intended room sizes (e.g., beds and seating appear placed in reshaped rooms that do not exist in the plan)."

However, geometry contains non-planar/curved wall choices (architecturally inconsistent with the source), and the camera/projection reads more like a perspective isometric rather than a strict orthographic isometric. Composition is clear but fidelity-driven distortions reduce technical quality."

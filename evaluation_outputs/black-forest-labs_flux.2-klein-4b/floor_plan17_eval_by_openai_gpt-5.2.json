        "notes": "Major mismatch between 2D layout and 3D. The 2D plan is a 4-bedroom apartment with two balconies (living + master), a defined foyer, kitchen + utility, servant room, dress area, and multiple toilets. The 3D render shows a simplified layout with fewer distinct rooms (appears closer to ~2 bedrooms), different wall geometry (curved/angled partitions not present in plan), and lacks the balcony interfaces. Door locations/orientations and window openings do not correspond to the plan\u2019s perimeter and balcony doors. Overall room sizing and circulation proportions are significantly distorted (living/dining overly dominant; bedroom wing configuration not preserved)."

Multiple required spaces are missing, and some newly introduced wall shapes create non-existent circulation. Door embedding is incomplete/incorrect relative to the plan (several openings absent or placed differently). The model also appears to introduce undefined rooms/spaces not labeled in the plan."

        "notes": "Living room seating cluster and a dining table exist, but they do not align well with the plan\u2019s furniture arrangement and room boundaries. Several rooms that should contain beds (Bedrooms 2/3/4) are not clearly present, so furniture-to-room mapping is largely unfaithful. Furniture scale is generally plausible within the rendered spaces, but because room sizes are distorted, the overall mapping is inaccurate."

        "notes": "Lighting is clean and the model is visually readable. However, the camera appears more perspective than true isometric/orthographic. Geometry is mostly clean, but the use of curved/irregular walls reduces clarity relative to the rectilinear plan and contributes to perceived distortion. Overall presentation is decent despite poor plan fidelity."

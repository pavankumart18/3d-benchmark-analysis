The main entrance at the top-right (double door) is not placed there in the 3D render (E2/E3). Several internal wall runs/offsets near the kitchen/central corridor do not align to the rectilinear wall geometry in plan (E2). Door positions and swings for the wash/toilet zone do not match the 2D door locations/orientations (E2/E3). Window placement is inconsistent: dining/bedroom windows shown in plan are missing or moved, and extra/different windows appear in the 3D (E1/E2/E5). Overall room proportions are distorted (living/entry/stair region compressed and reconfigured) (E4)."

        "notes": "Core adjacency relationships are broken by the missing staircase block (E1) and the altered entrance location (E2), changing circulation. The wash area and toilet appear effectively merged/reshaped into one bathroom volume rather than the two distinct spaces shown (E2/E4). A hallucinated narrow hall/room at the bottom-right replaces the stair footprint (E5). Wall thickness looks mostly consistent, but wall embedding around doors/openings is inconsistent with the plan\u2019s openings (E2/E3)."

Bathroom fixture layout does not match the separate wash/toilet arrangement (E2). Some furniture scale feels plausible, but mapping accuracy is limited due to room reshaping (E4)."

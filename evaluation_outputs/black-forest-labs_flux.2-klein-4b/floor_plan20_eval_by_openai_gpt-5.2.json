As a result, the living/dining north edge and the bedroom-2/bedroom-1 exterior edges are enclosed differently than the plan (E2). Several door locations/orientations that should connect to deck/balconies are absent or replaced by solid walls (E1/E3). Window placement is largely missing/simplified compared to the many openings implied on the plan perimeter (E1/E2). Room proportions are noticeably altered by the removal of deck/balconies, making the main living zone read deeper/more enclosed than in plan (E4)."

Adjacency relationships that rely on outdoor spaces (living\u2194deck, bedroom-2\u2194balcony, bedroom-1\u2194balcony) are not preserved (E2). Bathrooms and utility/kitchen cluster are generally in the correct region, but the left-side toilet arrangement appears simplified and may not match exact partitioning/door placements from the plan (E2/E3). A zig-zag/angled partition along the top of living/dining appears in 3D but is not represented in the 2D plan (E5)."

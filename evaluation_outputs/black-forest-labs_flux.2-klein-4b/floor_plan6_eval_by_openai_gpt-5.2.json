The main Kitchen/Living zone and the Bedroom are in roughly the correct halves of the plan, but multiple wall runs and openings do not match the 2D drawing. Door locations are largely represented as open curved passages rather than the specific hinged door positions shown in plan. Window positions/counts do not match the plan (notably the long run of bottom-wall glazing is absent). Bedroom and central service-core proportions appear distorted (bedroom reads oversized relative to living area vs plan)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is generally consistent and rooms remain broadly adjacent in the expected relationships (living adjacent to bedroom and bath core). However, the door implementation is structurally unfaithful (arched/curved openings instead of the plan\u2019s door leaves and swings). At least one service/closet/utility subdivision in the central core is not clearly preserved, and the stair enclosure/right-side corridor structure does not match the crisp rectilinear partitioning and openings indicated in the 2D plan."

Scale is mostly plausible, though room size distortions make some pieces (bedroom vs living) feel mismatched to the 2D proportions."

However, geometry includes non-plan-like curved wall cutouts/openings that reduce architectural clarity, and the presentation reads more stylized than a faithful orthographic/isometric translation of the 2D plan."

(E2/E4) The top corridor/hallway shown in the 2D plan (connecting left bedroom \u2192 bath \u2192 office \u2192 right bedroom) is not faithfully represented; the 3D model reads as a much more open central space with altered wall runs. (E2) Bathroom/adjacent small-room configuration differs: the 2D plan has one bathroom + one separate office/desk room; the 3D shows a different partitioning and fixture placement/orientation. (E2/E3) Several door locations/swing/orientation do not match the 2D plan (notably the right bedroom entry and the doors serving the top rooms). (E2) Window placement does not match: the 3D adds prominent right-wall windows not indicated in the plan and misses/relocates the plan\u2019s small top-wall windows. (E4) Room proportions are notably distorted (central open area enlarged; top rooms/corridor widths not preserved)."

        "notes": "Structural relationships are inconsistent. (E2) Adjacencies implied by the plan (clear separated corridor with discrete doorways into bath and office) are altered/blurred in the 3D. (E5) A curved/diagonal interior wall/partition appears in the 3D that is not present in the 2D plan. (E2) Door embedding into correct wall segments is inconsistent with the plan in multiple spots (top rooms and right bedroom). Wall thickness looks generally consistent, but the wall network itself does not match the drawing."

(E2/E1) Left bedroom in 2D shows two single beds; 3D shows a different bed arrangement (appears as a single/double bed setup rather than two singles). (E1/E2) The office/desk room furniture from the 2D plan is not clearly present as a distinct room with a desk in the correct location. (E2) Kitchen casework/appliance layout is not faithfully recreated (2D shows a defined bottom-right kitchen run with stove/sink/counters; 3D representation is incomplete/shifted). Scale feels plausible but is not anchored to the plan due to layout changes."

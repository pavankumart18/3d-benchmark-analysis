The 2D plan has a clearly separated BEDROOM (top-left), LIVING/DINING (center-left), KITCHEN (right), TOILET (top-right), UTILITY (far right), FOYER (bottom-right), and BALCONY (bottom-left). The 3D render shows mostly one large open space with only a small toilet area and a partial kitchen corner; bedroom, foyer, utility, and balcony are not represented as distinct enclosed spaces. Several walls are angled/curved in 3D while the 2D plan is predominantly rectilinear, indicating wall alignment errors. Door locations/orientations do not match the plan (arched openings without correct door leaf positions). Window placement/count does not match (3D shows limited windows compared to multiple openings in 2D). Room proportions are not preserved (living area dominates; bedroom proportion/shape missing)."

Utility space is not separated from kitchen as in 2D. Balcony volume/connection from living is not modeled. Wall thickness appears somewhat consistent, but interior partitions are missing/merged, and several openings are not embedded as true doors. No clear evidence of extra (new) rooms, but there are hallucinated geometric features (curved/angled partitions) not present in the plan."

Living/dining furniture is generic and not placed according to the 2D layout (sofa/dining position/orientation differ). Kitchen fixtures are simplified and do not reflect the L-shaped counter + utility arrangement. Scale is inconsistent (oversized open area relative to fixtures)."

Geometry includes non-plan-consistent curved/angled walls (distortion relative to the source), and openings are stylized (arched) rather than matching plan conventions. Overall composition is acceptable but not technically faithful."

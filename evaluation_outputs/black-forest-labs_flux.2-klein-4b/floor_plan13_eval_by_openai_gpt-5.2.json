The 2D plan\u2019s left-side lounge/dining + top-left balcony + central kitchen/laundry core + central bath/WC + two right-side bedrooms are not reproduced with correct placement. Circulation/entry is relocated, and major spaces (kitchen, balcony) are absent or unrecognizable. Bedroom zoning and corridor geometry differ substantially. Room proportions are also significantly distorted (living area and garage-side volume oversized relative to the plan)."

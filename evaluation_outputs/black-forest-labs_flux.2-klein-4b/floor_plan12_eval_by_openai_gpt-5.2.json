Multiple interior partitions are reshaped into curved walls not present in plan (E5/E4). Bath/WC location and subdivision are not represented. Balcony area is not modeled as an exterior space. Door positions and swing/orientation do not correspond to the plan\u2019s hall-to-bedroom and hall-to-bath openings. Window locations/sizes do not align with the plan\u2019s exterior openings."

Adjacency relationships are incorrect (e.g., Bath+WC core between Activity and Bed 4 is not correctly formed). Numerous hallucinated curved partitions and non-plan wall segments reduce fidelity. Wall thickness appears visually consistent, but the overall wall topology diverges heavily from the floor plan."

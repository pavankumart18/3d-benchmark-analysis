(E2/E4) Kitchen zone in the 2D plan (top-left open kitchen with L-shaped counters) is not represented as a kitchen in the 3D render; it reads as open living space with minimal cabinetry. (E2/E3) Main circulation/foyer and interior door locations do not align with the plan\u2019s bottom-center entry and adjacent closets/baths. (E2) The right-side connection wall/door location (\"Chandler & Joey's apartment\" door on living room right wall) is not clearly present in the 3D. (E2/E4) Wall geometry shows smoothed/angled/curved partitions that do not match the plan\u2019s orthogonal, stepped perimeter and room corners. (E2) Window locations don\u2019t match the plan: the plan\u2019s specific window runs/placements (large living room window on the top wall and other room windows) are not consistently mirrored; the 3D appears to introduce/shift window placement and sizing."

(E1/E2) Bathroom count/placement does not reliably match the 2D plan (which indicates multiple wet areas/fixtures across two bath zones); the 3D suggests fewer or relocated bath partitions. (E2) Bedroom placement/room boundaries differ from plan: the left bedroom suite and its relationship to the left bath/coat area is not preserved. (E4) Wall thickness and stepped perimeter offsets from the plan are not consistently preserved; multiple walls appear simplified."

Geometry is mostly clean, though several walls are oddly curved/angled compared to the plan, which reads as modeling distortion relative to the source rather than intentional design."

The 2D plan shows a large Dining Room with a distinct angled bay/window-seat on the right, an adjacent Kitchen with Pantry/REF, a Utility Room (W/D + HVAC), a separate WC, and a Central Hall with stairs. The 3D render instead depicts a different overall layout/room arrangement with multiple small central rooms and no clearly defined Kitchen/Pantry/Dining geometry matching the plan. Wall runs, room positions, and the right-side bay/window-seat geometry do not align. Door and window locations in the 3D model do not correspond to the plan\u2019s indicated openings and bay configuration. Room proportions are not preserved (Dining/Kitchen zone scale and shape are inconsistent with the plan)."

Several key plan-defined spaces are missing or not identifiable in the 3D. Openings (doors/windows) are not embedded where the plan indicates, and the distinctive exterior wall/bay condition on the Dining Room side is not faithfully modeled. The 3D includes extra partitions/rooms not supported by the provided plan crop."

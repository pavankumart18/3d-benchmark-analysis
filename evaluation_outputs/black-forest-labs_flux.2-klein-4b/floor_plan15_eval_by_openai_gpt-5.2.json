        "notes": "Overall layout does not match the 3BHK 2D plan. The 2D plan is a long, linear unit with central Living & Dining, three bedrooms (Master on far left, Bedroom-1 upper left of living, Bedroom-2 far right), multiple toilets, two balconies, kitchen + utility on the right, and wide passages. The 3D render depicts a much smaller, compact layout with only one clearly readable bedroom, a combined living area, and a kitchen/dining zone; the linear sequencing and room positions are not preserved. Door and window positions are largely inconsistent with the plan, and room proportions/elongation are significantly distorted."

        "notes": "Major program elements from the plan are missing (2 bedrooms, multiple toilets, utility, balconies, passages), and adjacency relationships (e.g., bedroom-toilet attachments, living-to-balcony, kitchen-to-utility) are not maintained. Several interior partitions in the 3D model do not correspond to any walls in the 2D plan, indicating hallucinated structure. Wall/door integration appears plausible as a standalone model, but it does not faithfully embed doors/walls per the source plan."

Several furniture groupings (desk/office-like setup) appear invented relative to the plan. Scale is generally consistent internally, but mapping to the 2D layout is largely incorrect."

However, it is not an accurate architectural isometric translation of the 2D plan (projection/orthographic faithfulness is poor relative to the source).

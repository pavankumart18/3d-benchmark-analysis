        "notes": "Overall layout in the 3D render does not correspond to the 2D plan. The 2D plan is a full house with living room, kitchen/nook, dining, study, 4 bedrooms, multiple baths, utility, and a 2-car garage; the 3D render depicts a much smaller, different configuration (few rooms around a central space). Major wall runs and room locations (e.g., garage block at lower-right, kitchen/dining/living massing on left/center, bedroom wing on right) are not preserved. Door and window locations do not match the plan\u2019s exterior openings and interior door positions. Room proportions are not comparable to the specified dimensions in the plan."

Several rooms in the 3D render have no clear correspondence to named rooms in the plan (hallucinated/undefined spaces). Interior openings are simplified/omitted and wall thickness/edge conditions are inconsistent with a plan-derived model."

The rendered furniture appears generic and placed in rooms that do not align with the plan\u2019s functions. Scale is only loosely plausible but not verifiable against the plan due to missing corresponding rooms."

However, it is not a faithful orthographic/isometric representation of the provided plan (cutaway walls and simplified geometry reduce clarity for verification).

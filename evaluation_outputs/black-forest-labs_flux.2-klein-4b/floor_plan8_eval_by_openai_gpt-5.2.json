        "notes": "Major layout mismatch between 2D and 3D. Living room/dining room/kitchen zones are not clearly partitioned per plan and several boundaries/offsets do not align. The central stair core shown in the 2D plan is not represented as stairs in the 3D, causing the entire top-center circulation to be wrong. Door locations and swing/orientation do not match multiple openings in the plan. Window placement is largely absent/unclear compared to the numerous exterior windows indicated in the 2D. Room proportions (especially kitchen/dining depth and the top-center core) appear distorted."

        "notes": "Key structural elements are missing or altered: the stair (with UP/DN) is not modeled; adjacency relationships around foyer/WC/stairs/kitchen do not match the plan. Several rooms appear merged/opened (dining vs kitchen; living vs foyer transitions) compared to the 2D wall layout. There are also added/altered wall shapes (curved/rounded partitioning) not supported by the 2D drawing. While wall thickness looks somewhat consistent, door embedding and the correctness of interior partitions are frequently incorrect."

Kitchen cabinetry/appliance layout (sink/range/island) is not faithfully represented. Furniture scaling is only loosely plausible and not anchored to the plan\u2019s fixture positions."

However, the camera is more perspective/isometric-like rather than a strict architectural isometric/orthographic presentation, and some wall/partition shaping (including curved elements) reduces plan-faithful clarity. Overall visually coherent but not technically precise."

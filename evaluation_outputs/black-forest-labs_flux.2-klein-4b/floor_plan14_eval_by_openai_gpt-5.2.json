The 2D plan has a defined foyer/entry zone at bottom-right leading into living/dining; the 3D render shows large exterior glazing/doors on the bottom edge and no recognizable foyer. Kitchen + utility zone (bottom-left in 2D) is not present as a distinct room in 3D. Decks/balconies (top side in 2D: one large near living/bed-2, one small near bed-1) are not represented in the correct locations; instead an exterior opening/balcony-like element appears on the bottom edge. Door and window placement does not match the 2D perimeter openings, and room proportions appear altered (living area shape/size and circulation paths differ)."

Adjacencies are wrong: in 2D the kitchen/utility adjoins living and sits near the common toilet; in 3D this block is missing/converted. The two toilets shown in 2D (C.TOI and TOI-1) are not faithfully recreated; the 3D top-left wet area appears mis-modeled (contains multiple WC fixtures and lacks the clear two-bath layout/placement). Decks are missing/relocated. Several openings appear placed without matching the 2D wall segments."

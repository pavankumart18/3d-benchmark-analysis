Door embedding is incorrect, especially for the toilet door which is recessed without an opening. Adjacency relationships are mostly correct for rooms but flawed due to wall misalignments. Missing rooms: The staircase area and 'Entrance to the House' are not fully represented or are heavily distorted/missing. No hallucinated rooms."

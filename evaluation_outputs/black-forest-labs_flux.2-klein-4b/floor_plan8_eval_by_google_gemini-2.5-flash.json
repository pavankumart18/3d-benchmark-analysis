However, wall alignment has several errors, especially in the Living Room and Dining Room areas, where the external wall shape is significantly altered. Door placements are largely incorrect or missing. Window placements are completely missing. Room proportions are distorted, particularly in the Living Room which appears significantly wider and shorter, and the Dining Room which is severely distorted in shape."

Adjacency relationships are mostly correct for rooms but detailed internal structures like the pantry and stairs are misrepresented. There are several missing rooms/areas including the closet next to the W/C, the stairs leading up/down, and the entire 'Playroom' area. The 'Pantry' is present but incorrectly rendered as a single wall unit, not a room. There are hallucinated elements in the 'Playroom' area, which has been replaced with a bedroom-like setting and a study area."

Lighting quality is decent but does not compensate for the structural flaws. Geometry is not clean, with distortions in wall shapes and corners. Visual clarity is moderate, but the significant structural deviations detract from the overall composition."

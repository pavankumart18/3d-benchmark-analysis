Kitchen block is shifted from the plan\u2019s bottom-left placement to a more bottom-center/right position, altering circulation. Balconies/decks do not match: the plan\u2019s large top deck (13'9\"x5') off Living/Dining is not represented in the correct location/extent; balcony/rail elements appear on the left side instead. Several door openings appear relocated and/or resized, especially around the foyer-to-living and bedroom access points. Window distribution on exterior walls does not correspond to the plan\u2019s openings. Overall room proportions (Living/Dining vs bedrooms, and deck sizes) look distorted."

        "notes": "Adjacency relationships are partially preserved (two bedrooms + two toilets exist), but key plan structure is not faithfully embedded: foyer/passage hierarchy is not clearly modeled, and the utility/service area is not clearly separated as a distinct room per plan. Door embedding/orientation is inconsistent with plan swing/placement. Hallucinated balcony/railing placement creates exterior geometry not supported by the plan, while the primary large deck appears missing/relocated. Wall thickness is visually consistent but does not compensate for plan deviations."

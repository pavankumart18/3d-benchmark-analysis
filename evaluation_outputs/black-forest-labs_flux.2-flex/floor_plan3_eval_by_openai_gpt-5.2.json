Entrance location and circulation do not match the 2D plan. Window and door positions do not correspond to the plan, and overall room proportions/footprints are not preserved."

The bathroom is not a small enclosed central room as in plan; instead a large open bath zone appears on the right. Stairs are not in the bottom-left zone as specified. Multiple extra partitions/rooms appear that are not in the 2D plan. Several required openings (notably the bottom-center entrance and specific top-wall doors/windows) are not faithfully embedded."

Bathroom fixtures are oversized and placed in an open area rather than inside the small bath. Furniture scale is generally plausible visually, but it is inconsistent with the intended program."

Minor issues: some elements feel staged (beds + open bath) relative to the plan, reducing interpretability as a faithful plan translation."

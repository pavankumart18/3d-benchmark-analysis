Hall area appears significantly smaller/narrower than the 2D plan (E4). Entry location/approach reads as shifted toward the left side in the 3D view compared to the bottom-center entry shown in plan (E2). Door positions are generally plausible but do not consistently match the exact wall segments/offsets indicated in the plan, especially around the hall/closet/laundry cluster (E2). Window distribution appears approximated rather than matching the exact count/spacing per exterior wall shown in the plan (E2)."

Wall thickness is fairly consistent visually, but several internal partitions/door embeds read simplified compared to the plan\u2019s more orthogonal layout (minor E4). No clear hallucinated extra rooms, but some built-ins/partitioning appear invented/simplified versus plan (E5)."

However, several pieces differ from the plan\u2019s shown placement and type (e.g., added sideboard/extra casework and d\u00e9cor not indicated; living layout and some bedroom items appear rearranged) (E2/E5). Scale is generally believable, but circulation clearances differ from the plan due to hall/room proportion changes (E4)."

Overall composition is strong and visually clear."

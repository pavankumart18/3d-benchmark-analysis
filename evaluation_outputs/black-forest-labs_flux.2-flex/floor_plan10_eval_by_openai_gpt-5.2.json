Key spaces that define the plan\u2019s zoning (Alfresco, Theatre, front Verandah/Portico/Entry sequence) are not represented in the correct locations. Several room placements/adjacencies appear shifted (notably the public zone vs. front entry), and the north-side bedroom/bath/laundry cluster does not read as the same configuration as the plan (E1/E2). Door and window positioning does not match the plan\u2019s indicated openings, and overall room proportions appear distorted (E2/E4)."

Missing or merged rooms are evident (Alfresco, Theatre, and likely one of Bed 3/Bed 4 not clearly present as separate rooms) (E1). Some added/merged spaces (extra dining/seating zone not corresponding to the plan\u2019s labeled rooms) indicate hallucination/incorrect segmentation (E5).

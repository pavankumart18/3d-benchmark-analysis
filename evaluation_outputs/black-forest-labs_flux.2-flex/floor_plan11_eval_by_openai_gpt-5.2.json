The 2D shows a large DINING ROOM along the bottom, KITCHEN with PANTRY/REF zone at upper-right, a small WC near the top center, and a defined CENTRAL HALL/UTILITY/HVAC cluster near the middle-left. The 3D render instead shows a dominant central stair core with surrounding rooms that do not correspond in placement/shape to the dining/kitchen/utility/WC arrangement. Door and window positions do not align with the plan\u2019s exterior openings (e.g., the long dining-room window band along the bottom edge is not represented correctly). Room proportions and overall footprint appear altered."

Several plan-defined small service spaces (UTILITY/HVAC/CRAWLSPACE access) are not faithfully modeled. Multiple additional rooms/partitions appear that are not indicated on the provided plan segment. Wall thickness/door embedding look visually consistent internally, but they are not consistent with the plan\u2019s wall lines and openings."

Wall alignment has some inaccuracies, particularly around the Foyer and Kitchen. Door placement and orientation issues are noted for the Foyer and Balcony entry, as well as the Bathroom door. Window placement is missing for the Balcony and distorted in the Bedroom and Living/Dining area. Room proportions are significantly distorted for the Foyer and Balcony."

Door embedding is incorrect for the Foyer and Balcony, which are not clearly defined as separate rooms as in the floor plan. Correct adjacency relationships are not fully maintained due to the Foyer and Balcony issues. The Balcony room is effectively missing or incorrectly rendered, and the Foyer is significantly altered. No hallucinated rooms are present."

The bed in the bedroom is also incorrectly scaled and oriented. Furniture in the Kitchen and Toilet show some inaccuracies in placement and type (e.g., sink in toilet, kitchen counter layout)."

Geometry contains some distortions, especially around the Foyer and Balcony areas where walls are not clearly defined. Visual clarity is moderate; the missing Balcony and distorted Foyer reduce overall comprehension."

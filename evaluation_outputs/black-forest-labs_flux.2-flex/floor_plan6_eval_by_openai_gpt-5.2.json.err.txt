    "notes": "Overall layout resembles the plan (large open living/kitchen on left, bedroom on right, central wet core, stairs at right), but multiple spatial deviations exist: the kitchen is rendered as a more enclosed nook with extra partitioning compared to the open-plan counter layout in 2D (E2/E5). The left exterior boundary in 2D has an angled/indented wall condition that is not preserved in 3D (E4). Main entry location appears shifted (2D shows entry at bottom-right corner; 3D door is more on the bottom edge, not matching the corner placement) (E2). Window distribution does not match: 3D shows extensive glazing along bottom/left that does not correspond to the fewer, discretely placed openings in the plan (E2/E5). Room proportions are altered: kitchen zone and central corridor/core occupy different relative area than in the plan (E4)."

  "structural_fidelity": {
    "score": 15,
    "max": 25,
    "notes": "Wall thickness looks generally consistent and doors are mostly embedded cleanly, but fidelity issues remain: adjacency relationships are partially broken by the extra kitchen enclosure/partitioning (kitchen reads as a separate room rather than open to living as in 2D) (E5). Exterior access on the left side (2D shows a distinct double/large door opening) is not clearly represented as a door in 3D (E1). The entry/hall configuration at bottom-right differs, suggesting incorrect door-to-stair/hall relationship (E2/E3). Several window openings appear added or relocated beyond the 2D specification (E5/E2)."

    "score": 6,
    "max": 10,
    "notes": "Furniture is broadly plausible (sofa in living, bed in bedroom, kitchen appliances), but does not match the plan’s intent: the kitchen island/peninsula configuration differs from the 2D counter layout (E2). The small bedroom/secondary sleeping area in 2D shows two beds; 3D depicts a different arrangement (single bed/alternate layout) (E2/E4). Some furniture placement (table/side furnishings) appears inferred rather than mapped (E5)."

  "aesthetic_quality": {
    "score": 19,

    "notes": "Render is visually clean with good lighting and readable room separation. Isometric view is acceptable, but projection is not strictly orthographic/isometric (noticeable perspective). Geometry is mostly clean with no major mesh artifacts; however, the abundance of windows/openings reduces plan-faithful clarity."

    "notes": "Major plan-to-render deviations: the 2D plan is predominantly rectilinear, while the 3D model introduces multiple curved/arched interior partitions that alter the circulation and wall alignment (E5/E2). At least one distinct room/space at the upper-left of the 2D plan is not clearly represented as a separate enclosed room in the 3D (E1). The lower-right bedroom/zone in the plan appears repositioned/reshaped in the 3D (more centered with altered boundaries) (E2/E4). Door locations and swing orientations do not consistently match the 2D door arcs, especially around the central hall and bath/bedroom entries (E2/E3). Window locations/sizes are significantly different (3D uses large continuous glazing not reflected in the 2D window layout) (E2/E4)."

    "notes": "Wall thickness and door embedding are generally clean and consistent in the 3D, but structural fidelity to the 2D is reduced by altered adjacency created by curved partitions (E5/E2). One room/area from the 2D (upper-left) is missing or merged into another zone (E1). Several elements appear added/reshaped (curved corridor/entry partitions and reworked exterior openings) that are not supported by the 2D plan (E5)."

    "max": 10,
    "notes": "Core furniture types align broadly (central dining table, living seating, beds), but placements do not reliably match the 2D arrangement due to the altered partition geometry and resized rooms (E2/E4). Furniture scale is mostly consistent and plausible relative to rooms."

    "score": 19,

    "notes": "Isometric presentation is clear with good lighting and generally clean geometry. However, the render reads more like a redesigned interior than a faithful extrusion of the 2D plan (curved walls, enlarged glazing), reducing perceived orthographic/plan-faithful accuracy. Visual clarity and composition are strong."

Balconies shown on the 2D plan are not modeled as exterior balcony spaces in the 3D render (replaced by windows/exterior wall). Entry/foyer location and circulation do not match the 2D layout (2D entry at left into a foyer; 3D shows a different entry/vestibule placement and path). Multiple toilet/bathroom locations and door orientations do not align with the 2D plan, and room size relationships (living vs dining and bedroom wing proportions) appear distorted."

Toilet blocks are simplified/rearranged relative to the 2D plan (count and placement mismatch). Some internal partitions and door openings appear reinterpreted, creating different corridor/room connections than the plan."

Scale feels generally plausible, though some rooms appear furnished more spaciously than their 2D proportions suggest."

However, it reads more like a perspective/isometric hybrid than a strict orthographic/isometric technical depiction. Geometry is mostly clean with no major artifacts, but the camera and window/door modeling choices emphasize aesthetics over plan-accurate fidelity."

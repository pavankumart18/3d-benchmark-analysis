        "notes": "Overall layout resembles the plan (central hall, left bedroom, bathroom zone, right bedroom, living + dining/kitchen), but multiple placement issues: the kitchen/dining zone is reconfigured (window moved to right wall and counters not matching the L-shape), the small top-center/right office/study room from the plan is not clearly preserved as a distinct room, and several door locations/hinge orientations do not match the 2D arcs. Room sizes/proportions appear altered (hallway widened, left bedroom and service rooms compressed)."

        "notes": "Major adjacency is mostly maintained (hall connects to bedrooms/living), but fidelity breaks in the top-center/right service area: the plan shows two separate small rooms (bath + office) with distinct doors; the render appears to merge/repurpose that area. Some wall runs and interior partitions differ in length and alignment versus the plan, and window/door embedding does not consistently match the drawn openings."

        "notes": "Furniture does not map reliably to the 2D plan: the left bedroom in the plan has two single beds, but the render shows one bed; the dedicated office/study furniture is not placed in the corresponding small room (desk appears in the bedroom instead). Kitchen layout and dining adjacency are simplified/changed relative to the plan. Scales are generally plausible but not faithful to the plan\u2019s arrangement."

However, some openings and partitions look simplified, and a few door placements feel visually inconsistent with typical clearance (minor compositional/architectural clarity issues)."

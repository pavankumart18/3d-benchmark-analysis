Door locations/orientations do not consistently follow the 2D plan (notably the main entry and interior doors). Window placement is inconsistent (living-side window appears missing/relocated). Several proportions look off (balcony depth and corridor/transition space appear enlarged vs the plan; bedroom furniture orientation suggests altered usable proportions)."

However, the render introduces/expands a hallway-like zone and adds built-in/storage elements not clearly present in the 2D plan, reducing fidelity. Some doors appear embedded/placed differently than the plan indicates."

Bedroom furniture does not clearly match the plan\u2019s layout/orientation (bed placement/orientation appears different; added desk/storage not shown). Furniture scale looks mostly plausible relative to rooms, but the altered circulation space suggests layout drift."

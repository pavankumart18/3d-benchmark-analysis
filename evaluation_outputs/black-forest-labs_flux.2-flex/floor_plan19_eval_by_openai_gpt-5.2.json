The 2D plan shows 4 bedrooms (BED-1/2/3/4) plus two distinct decks; the 3D render appears to show only 3 bedrooms and lacks the long, angled top deck geometry. Overall footprint is more rectangular in 3D, losing the plan\u2019s top-side angle and deck offsets. Several room adjacencies (right-side bedroom/bath cluster and deck connections) do not match the 2D layout. Door and window positions are broadly plausible but do not correspond to the specific openings shown in plan."

        "notes": "Missing room(s) and exterior spaces indicate low structural fidelity. The plan\u2019s right-side BED-4 + nearby common toilet arrangement is not faithfully reproduced (BED-4 appears missing/merged). The two-deck configuration (large central deck and smaller deck off BED-1) is not preserved. Wall layout is simplified, losing key offsets/angled segment. Some internal partitions/bathroom placements appear reinterpreted rather than matched. A likely hallucinated small room/area (with bicycle) appears that is not present on the 2D plan."

Several rooms\u2019 contents (storage/extra area) do not correspond to labeled spaces in the plan. Scale looks internally consistent, but it is not consistent with the specific room dimensions/proportions shown on the 2D plan."

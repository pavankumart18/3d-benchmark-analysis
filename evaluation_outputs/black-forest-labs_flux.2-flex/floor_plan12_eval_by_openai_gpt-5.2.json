(E1) The BATH and separate WC shown centrally on the plan are not clearly present as correct rooms with fixtures in the render. (E2/E4) Central corridor geometry is changed (render uses curved/rounded corridor walls and different junctions) vs the plan\u2019s rectilinear hall. (E2/E3) Door locations and swing/orientation do not match the plan (arched openings/offset doors vs specified door positions). (E2/E5) Window placements/counts differ notably (extra/moved windows in bedrooms/living areas vs plan). Room sizes/proportions and balcony relationship appear altered."

(E2/E3) Door embeddings/openings are not placed/formed as in plan (arched portals instead of standard door openings; mispositioned entries). Wall thickness looks generally consistent but overall wall layout fidelity is low."

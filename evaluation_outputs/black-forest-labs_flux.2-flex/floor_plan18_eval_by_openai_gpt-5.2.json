(E1/E2) Balcony at bottom-left is not correctly formed/positioned; 3D shows a recessed exterior pocket near entry but not the plan\u2019s balcony relationship to living. (E2/E3) Several interior door locations/orientations do not match: plan has a defined entry\u2192foyer\u2192living sequence and separate living\u2192kitchen and living\u2192toilet doors; 3D door placements are simplified/shifted. (E2) Toilet location is not as clearly top-center/right as in plan; appears more central, affecting circulation. (E4) Room proportions appear altered: kitchen zone reads larger/open compared to plan; living/foyer proportioning differs due to missing foyer."

(E1/E2) Balcony not faithfully modeled as a distinct exterior room off living. (E2) Adjacencies are altered: in plan foyer buffers entrance from living and sits adjacent to kitchen; in 3D this adjacency/circulation is not preserved. (E2) Door embedding/partitioning around toilet/kitchen appears simplified (fewer defined wall returns and openings). Wall thickness looks somewhat consistent but does not compensate for missing partitions."

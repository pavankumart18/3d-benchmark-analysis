(E2) Stair placement: 2D shows a long stair run tight to the right exterior wall; 3D shows a shorter internal stair run not aligned to the right perimeter. (E1/E2) The lower-middle room with two single beds (guest/second bedroom) present in 2D is not represented as such in 3D. (E3) Several interior doors swing/orient differently than the plan\u2019s arcs, especially around the central hall/bath/closet zone. (E4) Proportions are off: the open living area in 3D is larger/emptier relative to the clustered service core than the 2D indicates."

(E2) Bathroom/utility core partitioning differs: 2D indicates a tub/shower zone plus fixtures; 3D shows a different fixture layout and lacks the clearly depicted tub location. (E5) Additional/altered partitions create a kitchen enclosure/nook not present in the 2D. Wall thickness appears somewhat consistent, but several walls/doorways do not match plan positions."

(E5) Extra/altered furniture elements appear (e.g., additional bench/bed-like piece in the living zone) not clearly supported by the 2D. Scale is plausible, but mapping to the plan is weak."

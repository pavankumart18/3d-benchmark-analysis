        "notes": "Adjacencies are partially preserved (kitchen adjacent to dining/living; two bathrooms present; two bedrooms present), but structural fidelity is undermined by hallucinated stepped/platform elements, incorrect exterior opening placement on the right wall, and inconsistent interior wall/door embedding compared to the plan. At least one closet/utility partitioning near the entry/coat area does not match the 2D layout."

        "notes": "Furniture is plausible but not plan-faithful: kitchen casework shape differs from the L-shaped plan; living seating arrangement and rug placement do not match the 2D configuration; bedroom furniture placement/orientation is simplified and does not clearly follow the plan\u2019s bed/wall relationships. Scale appears generally consistent, but some circulation clearances are unrealistic compared to the plan."

Minor issues: slight perspective/orthographic ambiguity (reads as perspective isometric rather than strict axonometric), and some geometry (doors/wall junctions) looks stylized rather than architecturally exact."

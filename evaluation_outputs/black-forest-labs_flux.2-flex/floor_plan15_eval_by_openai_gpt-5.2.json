        "notes": "Overall layout resembles a 3BHK, but several plan-to-render spatial mismatches are present. The living/dining zone and its relationship to the main balcony appear shifted/reshaped versus the 2D plan\u2019s centered living+dining with balcony directly above. The internal corridor (\"wide passage\") geometry is simplified and does not preserve the plan\u2019s segmented passage alignment. Multiple door locations/swing directions do not match the plan (notably around living-to-passage and bedroom/toilet entries). Window placements are sparse and not aligned with the plan\u2019s exterior openings (several fa\u00e7ade windows shown in plan are missing or relocated). Room proportions appear altered: the living/dining footprint and some bedrooms/toilets look resized compared to the plan\u2019s stated dimensions and relative widths."

At least one toilet shown in the 2D plan (the small P. Toilet near the entrance/passage) is not clearly present as a distinct room in the 3D render, indicating a missing programmed space. Some room adjacencies appear swapped/merged (kitchen/utility block and nearby service spaces do not read as the same partitioning as the plan). No clearly new \"extra\" bedroom is added, but there are decorative/architectural elements not specified in plan (e.g., arched opening at entry)."

    "notes": "Overall layout matches the broad zoning (Living/Dining left, Kitchen top, Utility top-right, Toilet mid-right, Bedroom bottom-right, Balcony left), but several plan-to-3D deviations are present. Internal partitioning introduces an extra corridor/ante-space that changes circulation vs the 2D plan (Bedroom/Toilet access appears routed via a hallway rather than directly from Living/Dining). Wardrobe/closet placement is not aligned with the 2D plan’s indicated wardrobe band along the Toilet/Bedroom boundary. Door locations/orientations do not consistently match (entry door is not clearly present at the 2D plan’s top-left location; bedroom/toilet doors appear repositioned to the corridor). Window/glazing does not match: the 3D shows additional/expanded exterior glazing (notably at the Bedroom and right-side exterior) that is not indicated in the 2D plan. Several room proportions appear altered (Balcony depth/area and Living/Dining open area vs added corridor)."

    "notes": "Wall thickness and door modeling are generally consistent and clean, but the structural relationships deviate from the plan due to added partitions/circulation space. Adjacencies are mostly preserved (Kitchen-Utility, Toilet near Bedroom), however access relationships differ (Living-to-Bedroom and Living-to-Toilet appear changed). No primary rooms are entirely missing, but the added corridor/closet-like zone constitutes a structural hallucination not present in the 2D plan."

    "notes": "Living/Dining furniture (sofa + round dining table) and Bedroom bed placement are broadly consistent with the plan’s intent. However, the plan-indicated bedroom work/side furniture (desk area) is not mapped into the bedroom as shown in 2D, and storage/wardrobe representation is relocated (open shelving/closet appears outside the bedroom rather than along the planned wardrobe wall). Overall scale looks plausible."

    "notes": "Isometric presentation is strong with clear composition and generally clean geometry. Lighting is adequate and materials are coherent. Minor issues: perspective/isometric purity is not perfectly orthographic, and some openings/railings/glazing read as stylized rather than plan-accurate."

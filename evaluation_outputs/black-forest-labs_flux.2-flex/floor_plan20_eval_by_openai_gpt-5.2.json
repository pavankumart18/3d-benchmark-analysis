        "notes": "Overall layout roughly resembles a 3-bedroom plan with central living/dining and a central kitchen, but multiple key spatial placements diverge from the 2D plan. Major mismatch: the 2D plan\u2019s DECK is located along the top edge of the living/dining, whereas the 3D render shows an extended balcony/terrace running along the left side of the unit (E2/E5). Bedroom/bath cluster geometry on the left (Bedroom-3 with Toilet-3/Toilet-4 and the lobby connection) does not align cleanly; corridor/lobby offsets appear altered (E2). Door positions for several rooms (notably around toilets and bedroom entries) do not match the plan\u2019s door locations/swing relationships (E2/E3). Window/balcony openings are inconsistent: balcony door placements and long glazing runs do not correspond to the plan\u2019s openings (E2). Room proportions appear distorted: living/dining depth vs. width and bedroom sizes do not preserve the stated plan proportions (E4)."

        "notes": "Some adjacency relationships are preserved at a high level (kitchen near living/dining; bedrooms on both ends), but the left-side service/toilet grouping and balcony/deck relationships are not faithful (E2). At least one of the four toilets from the plan is not clearly represented as a distinct room in the 3D (E1). A large exterior balcony/terrace element appears that is not present in the 2D plan footprint as drawn (E5). Door embeddings are inconsistent: several doors appear placed where the plan shows wall or different openings, and some toilet/room entries appear re-routed (E2/E3). Wall thickness looks broadly consistent but intersections show occasional misalignment/clipping at junctions (E6)."

Living/dining furniture placement differs (sofa/TV/dining table orientation and position), and bedroom furniture layouts (bed orientation/side furniture) do not consistently follow the plan (E2/E3). Several furniture items appear scaled generically rather than reflecting room dimensions implied by the plan (E4)."

        "notes": "Render is visually clean with coherent materials and readable spaces. Camera is a reasonable isometric-like view, though it shows mild perspective rather than strict orthographic isometric (minor deduction). Lighting is acceptable and geometry is mostly clean, but there are some awkward wall junctions/door collisions and overly uniform glazing runs that reduce clarity (E6). Overall composition is clear."

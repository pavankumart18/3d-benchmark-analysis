        "notes": "Major plan-to-render deviations. The 2D plan is predominantly rectilinear, but the 3D model introduces multiple curved interior walls/openings that change circulation and room boundaries (E5/E4). The top-left space in the plan appears as a distinct non-bedroom room (shown with a table/chairs), but the 3D render shows a bedroom there (E2). Several interior door locations and swing orientations shown in the plan are not respected in the 3D (many are replaced by open arched/curved passages or appear shifted) (E2/E3). Window locations and sizes do not consistently match the plan\u2019s exterior wall openings; multiple large windows in the 3D appear repositioned/upsized relative to the 2D (E2/E4). Overall room proportions are distorted, especially the central living/dining zone vs. adjacent rooms (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall geometry fidelity is poor: curved partitions and non-plan wall breaks are introduced (E5) and wall thickness/edge alignment is inconsistent with the 2D diagram (E4). Door embedding is frequently incorrect or omitted (arched openings where doors exist in plan) (E1/E2). Several adjacency relationships are altered by the curved/shifted partitions (e.g., hall/room interfaces on the right side and central zone) (E2). At least one planned distinct room/space (top-left dining/sunroom/secondary room) is effectively replaced by a bedroom configuration (E1/E2). No clearly new fully enclosed extra rooms are added beyond the distorted partitions, but the added curved vestibules/alcoves behave like hallucinated structural elements (E5)."

Furniture scales and clearances are inconsistent with the plan\u2019s tighter rectilinear layout; the 3D suggests widened circulation due to distorted wall geometry (E4)."

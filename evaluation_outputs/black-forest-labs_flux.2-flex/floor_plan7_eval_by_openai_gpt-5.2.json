        "notes": "Overall zoning roughly matches (dining left, kitchen top, living right, bedroom bottom-left, service core central, stair wing right), but multiple critical layout mismatches: entrance location/door not represented (E1/E2), stair form and placement differs (spiral added; straight run differs) (E5/E2), wash area + toilet configuration does not match the 2D split and door locations (E2/E3), several interior doors appear in different positions/orientations than the plan (E2/E3), and room proportions (kitchen/hall widths and stair wing proportions) appear distorted versus the plan (E4). Window locations/counts also do not clearly correspond to the plan (E2)."

        "notes": "Adjacency is partially preserved (major rooms remain neighbors), but key structural fidelity issues: hallucinated spiral staircase not in plan (E5) and the stair configuration in the right wing does not match the plan (E2/E4). The service core (wash area over toilet) is not faithfully separated/represented (E2/E1) and door embedding/locations between corridor/living/service rooms are inconsistent (E2/E3). No clear evidence of the main entrance door where the plan shows it (E1). Wall thickness looks generally consistent, but openings and partitioning diverge materially."

Minor deductions: camera/projection reads slightly perspective rather than strict orthographic isometric (E6), and some cutaway edges/openings read stylized rather than plan-accurate (E6)."

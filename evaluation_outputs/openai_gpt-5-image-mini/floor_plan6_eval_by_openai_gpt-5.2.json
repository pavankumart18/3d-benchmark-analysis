The 2D plan has a right-side stair/hall/entry zone and a central wet/closet core; the 3D render shows a simplified open plan with a different internal partition scheme (E2/E4). Left exterior wall in 2D is angled/indented; 3D outer shell is essentially rectangular (E4). Door locations and orientations are not respected (2D shows multiple hinged doors with specific swings; 3D uses generic openings in different positions) (E2/E3). Windows are largely missing or relocated: 2D has multiple exterior openings (notably along the bottom and left), while 3D shows only a single bedroom window-like opening (E1/E2). Room proportions are notably altered (living area and circulation simplified; bedroom/core sizes differ) (E4)."

Bathroom/WC area shown in 2D is missing in 3D (E1). Right-side stairwell/corridor shown in 2D is missing in 3D (E1). Closet/wardrobe zone (hatched area in 2D) is missing (E1). A hallucinated extra enclosed room/box volume appears near the top-center of the 3D model that does not match any clearly defined room in the 2D plan (E5). Wall thickness looks consistent in the render but does not correspond to the plan\u2019s heavy structural walls vs lighter partitions (E4)."

Scale is plausible but not verifiable against the plan due to missing/shifted walls and openings; relative sizing between rooms/furniture is affected by proportion distortions (E4)."

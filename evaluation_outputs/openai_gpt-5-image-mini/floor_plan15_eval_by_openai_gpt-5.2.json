The 3D render shows a compact, near-square footprint with a central living zone, whereas the 2D plan has a long central living/dining with two distinct wide passages and rooms spread left-to-right. Bedroom locations and adjacencies are inconsistent (master/bedroom-1/bedroom-2 positions do not align). Door locations and openings are largely not where the plan indicates. Window placement does not correspond to the plan\u2019s exterior wall openings and balcony glazing."

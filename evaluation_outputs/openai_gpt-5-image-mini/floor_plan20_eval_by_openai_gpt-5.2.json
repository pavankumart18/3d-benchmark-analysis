Bedroom placement is approximate but not matched to the plan\u2019s left/right zoning. The deck (top of plan) and right-side balconies are not represented correctly. Interior partitions (kitchen/utility/toilet blocks/lobby) do not align with the 2D wall geometry. Door and window locations largely do not correspond to the 2D openings. Significant proportion drift: living/dining becomes oversized while service core spaces (kitchen/toilets/utility/lobby) collapse or vanish (E2/E4)."

Multiple required rooms are missing (deck, utility, lobby, office/maid, several toilets) and at least one balcony-like space is hallucinated/relocated relative to the plan (E1/E5)."

Scale is generally consistent, but the lack of mapped service-area furniture/fixtures reduces accuracy (E1/E2)."

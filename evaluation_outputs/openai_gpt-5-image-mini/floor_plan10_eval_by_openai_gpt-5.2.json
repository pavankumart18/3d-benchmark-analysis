The 2D plan includes a clear right-side Living + Alfresco + Garage massing and a left-side Theatre/bedroom wing; the 3D render compresses/rearranges these zones into a more generic rectangular footprint (E2/E4). Door locations and orientations do not match the plan\u2019s numerous hinged doors (notably around Entry/Study/WIR/Ensuite/Laundry cluster) and several openings appear placed arbitrarily (E2/E3). Window placement count/positions do not correspond to the plan\u2019s exterior elevations (e.g., long Living/Alfresco glazing is not reflected) (E2). Room proportions (Living, Garage, Theatre, Master suite) are not preserved; spaces are normalized to similar sizes (E4)."

Multiple rooms from the 2D plan are missing entirely (Garage, Alfresco, Portico, Verandah, Pantry, WIL, multiple WCs, Ensuite, WIRs) (E1). Adjacency relationships are incorrect: e.g., Garage should connect near Entry; Alfresco should adjoin Living; Master suite suite/ensuite/WIR cluster should be bottom-left; these relationships are not represented (E2). Several rendered rooms/openings appear as generic partitions not traceable to the plan (hallucinated/extra rooms or reshaped circulation) (E5)."

Lighting is flat/simple and lacks definition but does not obscure geometry. Minor issues: openings/doors are simplified and some cutouts look inconsistent, reducing architectural clarity."

Kitchen is rendered as a fully enclosed room with an interior door, while the 2D plan shows the kitchen as an open area connected to dining/living (no separating wall). Bathroom location/enclosure is incorrect: the plan has a centered enclosed bathroom block with doors; the render shows a toilet placed in the open circulation area with no matching bathroom room volume. Living/dining zoning is altered by added partitions/alcoves not present in the plan. Window and entrance positions do not match the plan\u2019s marked openings. Overall room proportions and the relationship of the stair zone to adjacent spaces are notably distorted."

        "notes": "Adjacency relationships are broken (kitchen separated; bathroom block missing/incorrect). Several doors are added/shifted compared to plan, and door embedding does not correspond to the 2D door swings. At least one planned room (enclosed bathroom) is missing as a proper room, and at least one partitioned room/alcove is hallucinated. Wall thickness looks visually consistent, but fidelity to the specified wall network is poor."

Living sofa/coffee table are added without corresponding 2D furniture references. Bathroom fixtures do not match the plan\u2019s bathroom configuration (toilet is exposed in open area). Furniture scale is generally consistent, but mapping to the plan is weak."

Room layout only loosely resembles living/dining/kitchen adjacency; the top-right space is modeled as a bedroom-like room instead of the labeled playroom. Interior partitions around foyer/closets/WC/pantry are largely incorrect or absent. Door locations/orientations are mostly not represented (openings are generic). Window placements and counts do not match the plan."

Adjacency relationships are wrong in the entry/service core (foyer-closet-WC-stair/pantry cluster). Door embedding is simplified; many plan doors are not modeled as doors."

Kitchen fixtures (sink/cooktop placements) do not clearly match the plan\u2019s counters/appliance layout. Living/dining furniture is plausible but not plan-accurate.

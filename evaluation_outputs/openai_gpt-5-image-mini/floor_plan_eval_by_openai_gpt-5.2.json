Wall alignments and offsets do not match the stepped perimeter and interior jogs shown in the 2D plan (E2/E4). Door locations/orientations are largely absent or incorrect (no clear entry door on right wall; no correct swings for bedrooms/baths/closets) (E1/E2/E3). Window layout does not match: the plan shows prominent living-room glazing and bedroom windows, while the render omits bedroom windows and simplifies/relocates living/dining windows (E1/E2). Room proportions are noticeably distorted (kitchen/bathroom/hall widths simplified) (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness appears mostly consistent in the render, but major plan elements are missing: closet at top-left, coat/entry storage zone, den/hall configuration, and one of the bathrooms (E1). Adjacency relationships are incorrect because missing rooms collapse circulation (e.g., entry-to-den/hall/baths not preserved) (E2). Several partitions are invented/simplified (kitchen nook/partial walls) relative to the plan (E5). Door embedding is not faithful (doors largely not modeled as embedded openings with correct placement/swing) (E1/E2/E3)."

Furniture scale is generally plausible but simplified; kitchen fixtures (L-shape vs linear + separate stove nook) diverge from plan-based layout (E2/E4)."

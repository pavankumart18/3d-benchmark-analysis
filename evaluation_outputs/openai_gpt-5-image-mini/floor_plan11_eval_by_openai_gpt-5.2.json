The 2D plan shows distinct Central Hall, WC, Utility Room (with WH/HVAC), Kitchen, Pantry, Dining Room, and a right-side bay/window-seat condition; the 3D render depicts a largely open-plan space with only a couple of small back/left rooms. Wall runs/jogs and room boundaries do not align, door locations/opening directions are not represented correctly, window locations/count do not match the plan, and overall proportions (relative room sizes and corridor widths) are substantially distorted."

Doors are shown as generic openings without matching the plan\u2019s embedded door positions and swings. No clear representation of plan-specific wall thickness transitions; exterior footprint/jogs (alcove/breakfast/bay/window-seat geometry) are not faithfully modeled."

A kitchen island and dining set are present but are not verifiably placed per the 2D plan (which emphasizes built-ins and specific areas like pantry/window seat). Furniture/appliance scale appears plausible but does not reflect the plan\u2019s exact layout constraints."

However, it is not a faithful architectural/isometric translation of the provided plan; projection feels more like a stylized cutaway than a strict plan-based model. Overall clarity is good, but accuracy-driven composition is weak."

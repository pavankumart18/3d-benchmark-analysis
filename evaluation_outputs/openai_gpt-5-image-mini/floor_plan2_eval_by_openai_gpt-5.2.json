Corridor/hall geometry and the living-room inset wall arrangement do not match the plan\u2019s wall layout. Kitchen area does not match the plan\u2019s bottom-right L-shaped counter + sink/stove run. Several interior doors shown in plan are missing or repositioned; overall room proportions skew toward a more uniform/rectangular footprint than the plan\u2019s stepped outline."

Kitchen fixtures/counters do not match the plan (no clear sink wall run; only an island/cooktop). Furniture scales are generally plausible, but placement does not follow the plan closely in service areas."

(E2/E4) Right-side bedroom/bath cluster and central-right hallway do not match the 2D partitioning; several interior walls are shifted/shortened, changing circulation. (E3) Multiple door locations/orientations from the plan (notably the bottom-center main entry and several right-hall doors) are not represented correctly; render uses generic openings that don\u2019t align to the plan. (E2) Window locations/counts do not match the plan (missing several exterior windows and mispositioned openings). (E4) Room proportions are distorted: the central living/dining area reads oversized relative to adjacent rooms, and some side rooms are undersized compared to the 2D plan."

(E1/E2) Bathrooms/wet areas shown on the 2D plan are not faithfully built (rooms present but fixtures/organization absent or incorrect). (E2) Adjacency relationships on the right side (bedroom-to-bath/hall connections) are altered due to different wall/door layout.

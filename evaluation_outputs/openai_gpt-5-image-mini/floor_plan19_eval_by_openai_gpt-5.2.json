        "notes": "Major mismatch between the 2D layout (irregular footprint with two decks at the top edge and multiple service cores) and the 3D model (more rectangular footprint, no deck geometry). Several rooms appear repositioned/merged: the bottom/service zone in plan (foyer + HO + multiple toilets + utility) is not represented with the same partitioning. Door locations/orientations are largely not consistent with the plan (many openings are missing or placed on different walls). Window locations/count are significantly reduced and do not follow the plan\u2019s exterior window distribution. Room proportions are not preserved (living/dining and corridor widths read differently; bedroom sizes/relationships appear normalized)."

        "notes": "Adjacency relationships deviate: plan shows distinct utility (bottom-right), multiple toilets (TOI-1, TOI-4, C.TOI, plus additional small WC), and a foyer/entry sequence; the 3D collapses these into fewer, differently shaped rooms. Missing elements include both decks and at least one bathroom block as drawn. A bathroom with a tub-like fixture appears that is not indicated in the 2D plan. Wall thickness looks broadly consistent internally, but the overall wall layout does not match the plan\u2019s perimeter offsets and interior jogs."

        "notes": "Some high-level furniture exists (sofa, coffee table, dining table, kitchen run, beds), but mapping to the plan is weak: the 2D shows a defined living + dining arrangement and kitchen/utility counters; the 3D places generic furniture without matching exact zones (e.g., dining placement/scale and kitchen/utility separation). Furniture scale is generally plausible but does not reflect the plan\u2019s specified room sizes (beds and circulation clearances appear inconsistent)."

However, it is not an orthographic-accurate translation of the plan: proportions and perimeter shape are simplified, and some openings/rooms appear procedurally generated. No major rendering artifacts, but the model\u2019s simplification reduces architectural clarity relative to the 2D intent."

        "notes": "Major deviations from the 2D plan. The 3D model loosely resembles an open living/kitchen zone on the left and a garage on the right, but the internal partitioning, hall geometry, and room arrangement do not match the plan. Door locations are represented mostly as open passages and do not correspond to the plan\u2019s hinged door placements or swings. Window positions and counts do not align with the exterior window layout shown in the floor plan. Overall room proportions (notably living area, bedroom wing, and service core) appear distorted compared to the specified dimensions and wall offsets."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is relatively consistent, but structural layout fidelity is poor: several plan-defined spaces are missing or merged, and the plan\u2019s adjacency relationships (hall-bath-utility-bedroom connections; master suite separation into bath + WIC) are not preserved. Doors are not properly embedded as specified (many missing actual door placements). The 3D includes partitioning that does not clearly map to the plan\u2019s closet/bath/utility boundaries, suggesting invented or simplified rooms."

The kitchen peninsula/working triangle and dining room setup do not match the plan\u2019s kitchen + nook + dining separation. Bedroom furnishing is simplified and does not confirm correct room identities. Scale is generally plausible, but placement does not validate plan accuracy."

Geometry is mostly clean with minimal artifacts, but simplifications (missing doors, reduced detailing) reduce architectural legibility versus a true plan-faithful orthographic/isometric reconstruction."

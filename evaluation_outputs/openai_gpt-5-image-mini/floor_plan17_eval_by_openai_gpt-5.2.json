The 2D plan is a 4-bedroom unit with multiple toilets, dress area, foyers, utility, and two balconies; the 3D render shows a simplified 3-bedroom-like layout with large open space and fewer partitions. Exterior footprint differs (render has a chamfered/angled corner and simplified perimeter). Adjacencies and circulation (foyer-to-living, bedroom corridor, wet-core clustering) do not match. Door and window positions are largely inconsistent with the 2D plan, and room proportions are not preserved (living/dining and bedroom sizes/locations are notably distorted)."

Multiple required rooms/spaces are missing and several expected adjacencies are broken (e.g., master bed + dress + attached toilet suite, utility/servant cluster, balcony connections). Several rooms in the render appear as generic empty cells without matching the plan\u2019s wet areas, indicating both missing elements and hallucinated/simplified spaces."

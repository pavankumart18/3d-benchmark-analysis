Wall alignment has numerous inaccuracies, primarily around door and window openings, and several walls are missing completely or have incorrect lengths. Door placements are largely incorrect, with many doors missing, misplaced, or having incorrect swing directions. Window placements are also frequently incorrect or missing. Room proportions are distorted in several areas, particularly the kitchen, living room, and master bedroom."

Adjacency relationships are heavily compromised by missing walls and altered room layouts. Numerous rooms are missing, including the Master Bath, WC, Study, and 2 Car Garage.

The central wet-area block (Bath + separate WC + hall doors) is not laid out per plan, and several circulation/door relationships do not match. Window/door locations are largely not traceable to the 2D plan, and room proportions (especially living/dining vs hallway/wet areas) appear distorted."

        "notes": "Wall thickness and basic enclosure are consistent, but key program elements from the plan are missing (balcony, separate WC, laundry, entry/linen). Adjacencies are partially preserved (kitchen near dining; bedrooms clustered), yet the wet-area configuration and corridor/door network do not follow the plan. No strong evidence of entirely new rooms, but the bathroom-toilet separation is collapsed into a single space, altering structure."

However, furniture does not help confirm correct room boundaries (since several walls/rooms are missing), and scale/spacing is somewhat generic relative to the plan\u2019s tighter service core."

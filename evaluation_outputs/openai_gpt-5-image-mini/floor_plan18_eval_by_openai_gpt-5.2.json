(E2/E1/E4) Bedroom is not a separate enclosed room; bed is placed in the main living space and the bedroom walls/partitioning from the 2D plan are not represented. Kitchen is generally on the right side but its footprint and relationship to foyer/utility are incorrect. Toilet is not correctly positioned/formed relative to the plan\u2019s top-middle bath and passage. Balcony is hinted at bottom-left but its connection/entry from living is not correctly shown. Door and window placements do not match the plan, and overall room proportions (living vs bedroom vs kitchen) are distorted."

Some wall thickness is consistent visually but walls/partitions are invented or omitted, creating hallucinated open space and incorrect partitions."

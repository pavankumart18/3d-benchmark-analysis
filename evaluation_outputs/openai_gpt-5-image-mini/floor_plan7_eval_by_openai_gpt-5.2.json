Wash Area + Toilet are not represented as two distinct rooms (merged/altered). Entrance/stair zone at bottom-right does not match the plan\u2019s stair footprint/location. Multiple plan windows are missing or relocated (living and bedroom especially). Room proportions/corridor widths are notably altered versus the 2D plan."

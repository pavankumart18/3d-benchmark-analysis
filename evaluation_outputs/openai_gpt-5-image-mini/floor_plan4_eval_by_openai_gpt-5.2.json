Bedroom placement is incorrect: the upper bedroom in the 3D render sits where the 2D plan shows the living room zone, and the right-side bedroom arrangement does not follow the plan\u2019s two-bedroom cluster (Bedroom 1 top-right, Bedroom 2 bottom-right). Door locations/orientations are largely inconsistent with the plan\u2019s hall-based circulation. Window placement is significantly wrong (3D shows two right-wall living windows only; 2D has multiple windows along top wall and in bedrooms). Room proportions are distorted (living/hall relationships and bedroom sizes do not preserve the 2D proportions)."

Some walls exist but do not align to the 2D partitioning, and door openings are not embedded where the 2D plan indicates. Multiple required rooms are missing and there are effectively hallucinated/merged spaces (open area replacing hall+bath+closets)."

Bathroom fixtures shown in 2D are missing in 3D. Furniture scale appears generally plausible but not verifiably consistent with the 2D room sizes due to major layout distortions."

(E2) Bed-1 is shown at top/center in 3D, but in plan Bed-1 is on the right side with an adjacent deck and attached toilet; this whole right-side suite is not represented correctly. (E1) Both decks/balconies shown in plan (living-side deck and Bed-1 deck) are missing in 3D. (E1/E2) Toilets are not correctly placed: plan has two toilets (C.TOI near Bed-2 and TOI-1 near Bed-1); 3D does not clearly show both in correct locations. (E2/E3) Door placements/orientations are not modeled per plan; most door leaves/swings are absent and openings do not correspond to the plan\u2019s entry/foyer and bathroom doors. (E2) Window placement is substantially reduced: plan has multiple exterior windows and deck openings; 3D shows only a few windows and omits balcony/door openings. (E4) Room proportions and circulation are distorted: the long living/dining (15' x 21'4\") and the foyer/entry corridor are not preserved; spaces appear compressed and re-partitioned."

(E5) Hallucinated/incorrect partitions: an extra room-like space at the top-right in 3D (with windows and a console) does not correspond to any labeled room in the plan; the right-side suite is reconfigured. (E2) Adjacency relationships are incorrect: in plan Bed-1 connects to TOI-1 and a deck; in 3D this adjacency is not maintained. (E2) Kitchen/utility adjacency is incorrect: plan shows a dedicated utility (5' x 7'8\") connected to the kitchen; 3D shows a different right-side service space that does not match location/shape. Wall thickness appears visually consistent, but the wall layout itself diverges heavily from the plan."

(E4) Furniture scaling feels broadly plausible, but because room sizes/proportions are wrong, relative scale-to-room is inconsistent. (E1) No fixtures/fittings consistent with two bathrooms are shown."

However, (E6) the scene is oversimplified (missing doors, balcony edges/thresholds, bathroom fixtures), reducing architectural clarity and making it less faithful to an orthographic/isometric interpretation of the provided plan."

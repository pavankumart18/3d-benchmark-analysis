Wall alignment accuracy is poor, with many walls either missing or misaligned relative to the floor plan. Door placement and orientation are incorrect throughout, with many doors missing. Window placement is completely incorrect, with windows either missing or placed in locations where they shouldn't be. Room proportions are not preserved, leading to significant dimensional deviations."

Adjacency relationships are completely broken due to the overall incorrect layout. Many rooms are missing (e.g., Maid's Room, multiple toilets, balconies, utility, deck, kitchen, living/dining).

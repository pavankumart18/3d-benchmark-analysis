The large bottom-right Stair/UP volume from the plan is not correctly represented (space shape/use differs). Several door locations/swing orientations in the central core (Bedroom\u2194hall and Wash/Toilet access) appear inconsistent. Window placement differs notably on Bedroom and some service walls."

Adjacency is partially preserved (Dining adjacent to Kitchen; Living adjacent to hall/core), but the Entrance adjacency and circulation path differ. Wall thickness looks generally consistent, but door embedding and the openings to the Entrance/Stair zone do not match the plan. No clear evidence of the plan\u2019s stair flight/landing geometry."

Scale is mostly consistent, though circulation clearances around the central core look tighter than the plan suggests."

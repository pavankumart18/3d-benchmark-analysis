        "notes": "Multiple spatial mismatches between the 2D plan and 3D render. Main living/dining is roughly central as in plan, but several walls/partitions do not align to the same offsets, creating different room footprints (E2/E4). The primary entry on the bottom facade is shown as a single door placed left-of-center, whereas the plan indicates a centered double-door entry into the living space (E1/E2). Interior door locations and swing/orientation are inconsistent in several places (hall/bedroom/bath transitions), altering circulation (E2/E3). Window layout is substantially incorrect: the plan shows numerous facade windows/openings, but the 3D has fewer, with different spacing and sizes; some expected openings (notably on the bottom/left facades) are absent (E1/E2/E4). Several room proportions are distorted (central space and some bedrooms/corridors appear scaled differently than plan) (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent in the 3D model (minor variation only). However, door embedding/placement is frequently incorrect relative to the plan (mislocated openings and different swing directions) (E2/E3). Adjacency is partially preserved (kitchen adjacent to living; bedrooms clustered right), but the exact hallway/bath/bed relationships are altered by shifted partitions and openings (E2). At least one planned exterior/ancillary space is not faithfully represented (e.g., terrace/balcony/opening configurations differ) (E1/E2). Some spaces read as added/reinterpreted rooms/alcoves (e.g., furnished nook-like areas) that do not match the plan as distinct rooms (E5)."

While major categories exist (kitchen, dining table, beds), placement/orientation differs from the 2D symbols (e.g., living seating layout, bedroom layouts, and kitchen arrangement) (E2/E3). Scale feels inconsistent in places (oversized central seating relative to circulation; some rooms appear too tight/too open compared to plan intent) (E4)."

Lighting is adequate but flat, with limited shadow definition. Geometry is generally clean with no major mesh distortions. Overall composition is clear; however, sparse/incorrect window depiction and simplified detailing reduce architectural clarity."

        "notes": "Overall rectangular footprint roughly matches, and the broad zoning (kitchen left, dining/living right) is partially respected. However, multiple critical mismatches occur: the left-side stair zone from the plan is not correctly represented; the central bathroom block is reshaped and expanded into multiple partitions; the main entrance at the bottom center of the plan is not clearly present/placed correctly; exterior door locations on the top wall (single door near kitchen and double door at dining) do not match the 3D; window distribution and placement on right/bottom walls differs substantially. Room proportions also drift (central core too large; left-side service/stair area proportionally incorrect)."

        "max": 25,
        "notes": "Wall thickness and general wall geometry are reasonably consistent, but fidelity to the plan\u2019s partitioning is weak. The plan shows a single compact bathroom centered; the 3D introduces extra internal rooms/corridor-like partitions around the core, changing adjacency relationships. The staircase element is effectively missing or not recognizable as the large left-side stair run shown. Several interior/exterior doors appear added or moved compared to the plan, indicating structural layout deviation and hallucinated openings."

        "notes": "Kitchen, dining, and living furniture are placed in broadly correct zones (kitchen fixtures left, dining table upper-middle/right, seating right). However, exact mapping to the 2D plan is not verifiable due to layout deviations (missing/altered stair zone and changed central core). Furniture scale appears generally consistent, though some pieces feel sparsely/loosely arranged relative to the plan\u2019s implied room extents."

Minor penalties: not truly orthographic (visible perspective), some geometry looks simplified/blocky (especially the central core), and openings/windows look inconsistently detailed relative to the plan."

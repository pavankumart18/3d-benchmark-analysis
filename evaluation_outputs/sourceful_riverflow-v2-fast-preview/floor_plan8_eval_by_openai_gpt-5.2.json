Dining room is not correctly defined/enclosed per the 2D plan (E1/E2), and the foyer/closet zone at upper-left is not clearly partitioned as shown (E2). Stair block exists but its surrounding walls/landing configuration does not match the plan layout (E2/E3). Door locations are largely not represented with correct positions/swings (E1/E2). Window runs are generalized and do not match the plan\u2019s specific window placement/counts on the perimeter, especially along the right/kitchen and playroom walls (E2). Room proportions are noticeably distorted (living area oversized; dining/pantry/foyer zone compressed) (E4)."

Adjacencies are weakened (kitchen/playroom separation and doorway condition not clearly matching plan) (E2/E3). A small enclosed room/partition at the bottom-right of the render does not correspond to any labeled room/partition in the 2D plan (E5). Wall thickness looks fairly consistent, but many door openings are either absent or not embedded where the plan indicates (E1/E2)."

Scale is hard to validate due to missing reference furniture; counters appear plausible but overall furnishing is incomplete."

Geometry is generally clean, but the render relies on simplified masses and repeated window cutouts that reduce clarity/faithfulness (E6). Projection is not strictly orthographic/isometric (minor perspective feel), and some edges/openings look generalized rather than precisely modeled."

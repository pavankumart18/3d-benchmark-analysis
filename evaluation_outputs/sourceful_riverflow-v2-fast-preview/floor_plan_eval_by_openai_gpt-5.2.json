Wall thickness looks generally consistent but openings/embeddings are simplified; some internal partitions appear shifted, changing circulation geometry."

Some scale feels off (oversized hall clearances relative to door widths)."

However, it is more of a perspective/isometric hybrid than a strict orthographic isometric; some geometry reads slightly softened/blurred, and door/window detailing is simplified which reduces clarity for verification."

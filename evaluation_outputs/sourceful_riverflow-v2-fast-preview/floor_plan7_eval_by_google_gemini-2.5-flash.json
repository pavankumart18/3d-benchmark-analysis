Wall alignment is inconsistent, with many walls appearing thinner or thicker than represented in the floor plan. Door placements are largely incorrect, and orientations are wrong for several. Window placements are not accurately preserved, with sizes and locations deviating. Room proportions are distorted, particularly in the 'Bedroom 1' and 'Dining' areas."

Adjacency relationships are mostly maintained, but the 'Wash Area' and 'Toilet' form a single room in the render. No rooms are explicitly missing, but the 'Wash Area' and 'Toilet' separation is lost.

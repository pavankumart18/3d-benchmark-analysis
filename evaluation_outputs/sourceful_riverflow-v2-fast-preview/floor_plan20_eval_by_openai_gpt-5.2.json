The 2D plan has a central Living & Dining with deck along the top edge and a kitchen+utility band at bottom center; the 3D render shows a simplified open central area with bedrooms arranged differently and without the deck/balcony geometry (E2/E4). Doors are largely missing/undefined in the 3D (no clear swings/orientation) versus many specific door locations in 2D (E1/E2/E3). Windows appear distributed uniformly on exterior walls in 3D and do not correspond to the plan\u2019s specific openings and balcony interfaces (E2). Room proportions are not preserved (bath/utility/lobby zones effectively collapsed), distorting the plan\u2019s intended widths and separations (E4)."

The 3D model effectively hallucinates a simplified apartment shell with fewer internal partitions and a different circulation pattern (E5). Door embedding correctness cannot be verified because most interior doors are not modeled or are indistinct (E1). No evidence of consistent wall thickness changes is visible, but the primary penalty is the missing/incorrect partition network and room count (E1/E5)."

Furniture scale appears broadly plausible, but because rooms are incorrect/missing, scale-to-room consistency is unreliable (E4)."

Projection is not strictly orthographic (mild perspective), lighting is flat but serviceable, and geometry is mostly clean with minimal artifacts. Visual clarity is decent, yet the lack of modeled doors/bath fixtures/balconies reduces interpretability."

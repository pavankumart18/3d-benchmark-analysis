        "notes": "Major layout mismatch to 2D plan. Living/dining, kitchen, bedroom, toilet, and utility/balcony zones are not placed or shaped consistently. Internal partition positions do not align with plan; the overall subdivision looks like a generic multi-room box rather than the specific plan. Doors are not in the plan-specified positions (notably bedroom/toilet access). No clear balcony opening and no verified window placements. Room proportions (living/dining should dominate; balcony is long/narrow; utility is small) are not preserved."

Door-to-room embedding is inconsistent with expected entry points (bedroom should not have an exterior door per plan)."

However, the render is overly sparse with limited detail and unclear room labeling; lack of openings (windows/balcony) reduces architectural readability.

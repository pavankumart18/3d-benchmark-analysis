        "notes": "Overall room zoning roughly matches (bedroom top/left, living central, kitchen right, toilet top/right, balcony left), but several key spatial placements deviate: the foyer is not clearly formed as a separate 4'6\"x3'10\" space (entry reads as opening into living), kitchen/utility boundary is altered, and balcony depth/shape appears enlarged. Multiple openings (kitchen/foyer, utility access) do not match the 2D layout precisely. Some window locations do not align with the plan (notably living/balcony-side fenestration)."

        "max": 25,
        "notes": "Adjacency mostly preserved (living connects to bedroom/toilet/kitchen; kitchen adjacent to utility), but fidelity issues: foyer separation wall/door logic is incorrect, kitchen entry is represented as a wide opening rather than the plan-indicated door, and the utility is rendered as a more enclosed room than the plan\u2019s narrow utility strip. Wall thicknesses are generally consistent, but several door embeddings/openings do not match the plan locations."

However, placement does not tightly follow the 2D arrangement (sofa position/orientation differs), and some items are generic rather than mapped to the plan specifics."

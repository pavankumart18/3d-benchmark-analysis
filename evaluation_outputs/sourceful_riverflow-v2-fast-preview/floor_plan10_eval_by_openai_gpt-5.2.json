Several openings/doors are not placed or oriented per the 2D plan, and exterior window locations/counts do not match. Some spaces (alfresco/living recesses, pantry niche areas) appear simplified, affecting proportions and edge alignment."

Geometry is mostly clean, though several architectural details (doors/windows/recesses) are simplified which reduces architectural clarity."

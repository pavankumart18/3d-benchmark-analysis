Lighting is basic and lacks detail, making the render flat. Geometry is distorted and not clean, with many jagged edges and inconsistent wall thicknesses. Visual clarity is poor due to numerous structural inaccuracies and missing elements, making it difficult to recognize the original floor plan. There are also hallucinated elements like the stairs changing direction halfway and the wall next to it."

        "notes": "Overall layout roughly matches (kitchen/dining top-left, living top-center, bedrooms to the right, service spaces bottom band), but several key plan-to-model mismatches exist: the Hall is not clearly enclosed/separated as in the 2D plan (appears overly open), the living\u2013hall separating wall reads as a low/partial partition rather than a full wall with an opening, and the bathroom/closet sub-partitions do not align cleanly with the 2D wall layout. Door locations between the central zone and Bedroom 1/Bedroom 2 are not clearly placed per plan (openings/door swings appear different or absent). Window count/spacing on the top fa\u00e7ade is simplified/shifted versus the plan, and at least one window appears on the bottom fa\u00e7ade that is not clearly indicated in the 2D plan. Room proportions drift: bathroom and central circulation feel enlarged while hall definition is reduced."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is visually consistent in the render, but structural fidelity to the plan is weak in several places: the Hall enclosure and its adjacency-driven door network (to Laundry, Bathroom, Bedroom 2) is not faithfully reproduced; some doors appear missing or replaced by open passages. Closet volumes/entries (especially the small central closet by the bathroom) are not clearly or correctly represented. A partial-height/low divider in the living area deviates from the plan\u2019s full-height wall intent. No clearly new/extra rooms are added, but multiple partitions are altered enough to change adjacency and circulation."

However, placement and scaling do not consistently match the 2D plan: living room furniture arrangement differs from the plan\u2019s depicted layout, and Bedroom 2\u2019s furnishing/bed orientation appears inconsistent with the plan. Some built-in elements (closet/bath fixtures alignment) do not map cleanly to the 2D diagram."

However, the camera is closer to a top-down perspective than a true isometric, and some walls/partitions read ambiguously (full-height vs half-height), reducing architectural clarity. Geometry is mostly clean with no major visible artifacts."

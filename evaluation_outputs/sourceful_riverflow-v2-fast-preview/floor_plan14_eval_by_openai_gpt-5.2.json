        "notes": "Overall room zoning roughly matches (Bed-2 left, Living/Dining center, Bed-1 right, Kitchen bottom-left, decks at top and top-right), but several plan-defining boundaries are altered. The foyer/entry pocket shown in 2D (with a defined foyer zone) is not clearly formed in 3D, reading as a more open direct entry into living. Multiple door locations/orientations from the 2D plan are not represented (render uses open portals), making door placement verification largely incorrect. Window/opening runs at decks/bedrooms are simplified and do not match the segmented window placement shown in 2D. Some proportional drift is visible: circulation/foyer and the kitchen/utility block proportions do not preserve the 2D footprint precisely."

        "max": 25,
        "notes": "Key adjacency relationships are mostly preserved (kitchen next to living, toilets near bedrooms/circulation), but several structural cues from the 2D plan are lost: door embedding is largely missing, and at least one partitioning condition around the foyer/corridor appears removed or shifted. Wall thickness appears visually consistent in the render but does not clearly follow the heavier structural wall pattern from the 2D drawing. Utility/shaft/service edges at the lower-left read ambiguous in 3D (geometry/voids do not clearly match the utility enclosure shown in 2D). No clearly new rooms are added, but multiple openings are effectively hallucinated as open passages due to missing doors."

        "notes": "Living room sofa/TV zone and dining table location are broadly consistent with the 2D intent, and both bedrooms contain beds placed in plausible matching positions. However, several items differ from the 2D layout (extra lounge chair/side tables and altered kitchen layout details), and exact placement relative to walls/openings does not match precisely. Furniture scaling is generally coherent, but the open-plan change around entry/living affects perceived scale and spacing."

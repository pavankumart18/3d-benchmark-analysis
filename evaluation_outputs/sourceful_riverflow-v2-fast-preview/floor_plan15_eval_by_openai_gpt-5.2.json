Wall layout does not follow the long linear plan with defined passages; door and window locations do not correspond to the plan; key exterior breaks (balconies) are not represented. Overall proportions/room sizing appear altered (bedrooms expanded/reshuffled relative to plan)."

Adjacency relationships (bedrooms-to-passages, living-to-balcony, kitchen-to-utility) are not preserved. The 3D render also suggests extra/reshaped room compartments not in the plan."

Multiple beds are shown, but their placement does not correspond to the three bedrooms defined in the plan. Furniture scaling appears somewhat consistent internally, but not aligned with room functions from the plan."

Lighting is acceptable and geometry is mostly clean, but the large floating roof slab and simplified openings reduce clarity. The view is not orthographic; mild perspective and the roof occlusion reduce plan-verification usefulness."

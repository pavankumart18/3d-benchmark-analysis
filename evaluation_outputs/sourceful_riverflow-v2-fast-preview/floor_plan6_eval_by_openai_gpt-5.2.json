Kitchen zone at top-left of plan (L-counter + island) is not represented in the 3D (E1/E2). Central service core (bath/WC/closet partitions) is reconfigured; wall runs and openings do not align with the plan (E2). Entry at bottom-right in plan is not clearly modeled as a door/opening in the correct location/orientation (E2/E3). Window distribution is substantially different: plan shows multiple openings along bottom and left edges; 3D shows different positions/sizes and fewer openings (E2). Proportions are altered: living area vs. service core widths and the bottom zone depth do not match the plan (E4)."

Door embedding is inconsistent/unclear: several plan doors (bedroom door, bathroom door, main entry) are not cleanly/accurately represented (E1/E2/E3). Adjacencies are partially preserved (living adjacent to bedroom/services), but the service rooms\u2019 boundaries and access relationships do not match the plan (E2). Kitchen is effectively missing (E1). A distinct extra sleeping/furniture zone at the bottom-left reads like an added room/bed area not present in the plan (E5)."

Geometry is mostly clean, but some openings/doorways and interior partitions look simplified and ambiguous relative to architectural elements (E6). Overall composition is clear but lacks key architectural details (kitchen/doors/windows) that reduce interpretability."

        "notes": "Overall zoning only loosely matches (living/dining generally to the left, bedrooms generally to the right), but multiple key plan-driven spatial relationships are not preserved. Balcony is not modeled as an exterior space. Wet-area core (Bath + separate WC) and the small service spaces (Laundry, Robe, Linen) are not clearly represented in correct positions. Several interior door openings do not align with the 2D plan\u2019s door locations/orientations, and window locations/counts do not match the plan\u2019s exterior openings. Room proportions appear more square/normalized than the plan\u2019s indicated dimensions (notably lounge/dining and bedroom footprints)."

        "notes": "Major elements from the plan are missing (garage and balcony) and several small labeled spaces (Laundry, Robe, Linen, separate WC) are not faithfully constructed as distinct rooms. Adjacencies are partially incorrect: the plan\u2019s central corridor/service core arrangement is not cleanly reproduced, and the bathroom/WC configuration appears merged/ambiguous. Evidence of hallucinated or re-partitioned spaces (extra open area/duplicate dining setup) reduces fidelity. Wall thickness looks mostly consistent, but door embeddings/openings are not reliably placed per plan."

Apparent duplicate dining table/extra seating suggests inaccurate interior mapping. Scale feels inconsistent (furniture-to-room clearances do not reflect the tighter plan proportions)."

        "notes": "Isometric viewpoint is generally correct and readable. However, it is not strictly orthographic/architectural (noticeable perspective feel and soft/blurred rendering). Lighting is flat with low contrast, and visual clarity is reduced by haze/low-detail materials. Geometry is mostly clean, but some partitions/door openings look indistinct, reducing interpretability."

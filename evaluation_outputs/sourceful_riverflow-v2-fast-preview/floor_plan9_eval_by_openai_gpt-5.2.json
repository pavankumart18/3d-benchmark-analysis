The 2D plan is a full house with multiple wings (garage wing, bedroom wing, living/kitchen wing, patios), while the 3D shows a small, near-rectangular shell with a few partitions. Room placement, wall alignment, door locations, and window locations are largely unrepresented or incorrect. Proportions are heavily distorted (major areas like the living room/garage/bedroom wing are missing entirely)."

Wall thickness appears somewhat consistent within the small model but does not reflect the plan\u2019s complexity. Doors are mostly absent and not embedded per the plan; windows/patio openings are not modeled as specified. The 3D contains generic partitions that do not map to the 2D layout."

However, it is not an accurate architectural isometric/orthographic representation of the provided plan. Lighting is soft and consistent; geometry is mostly clean with minimal artifacts, but the model is overly simplified relative to the plan, reducing clarity for verification."

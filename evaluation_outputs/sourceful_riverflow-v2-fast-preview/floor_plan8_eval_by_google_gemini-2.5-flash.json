Doors are not correctly embedded; they are either missing or represented as solid wall sections. Adjacency relationships are disturbed due to missing doors and altered wall layouts. The W/C and top-left closet area are largely missing or fundamentally changed. No hallucinated rooms were detected."

Lighting quality is decent for a basic render, providing clear distinctions between surfaces. Geometry is not clean, showing distortions and lack of detail. Visual clarity is moderate, but inconsistencies detract from overall composition."

    "notes": "Overall room layout roughly matches (2 bedrooms, central living/dining, kitchen+utility, 2 toilets, 2 decks), but several plan-specific spatial cues are not faithfully reproduced. Entry/foyer zone is not clearly defined as in the 2D plan (E1/E2). Multiple door locations/orientations are ambiguous or shifted because openings are simplified and some partitions around the foyer/passage are missing (E2/E3). Window layout from the 2D plan is largely not represented (most exterior window bands are absent/unclear) (E1/E2). Deck depths/room proportions appear altered (right deck and some circulation widths look inflated vs plan) (E4)."

    "notes": "Primary adjacencies are mostly correct (living between bedrooms; kitchen adjacent to utility; toilets on left and top-right) (OK). Wall thickness is fairly consistent (minor inconsistencies at cut edges) (minor E6). Door embedding is simplified (no clear swing/orientation; several openings read as missing doors) (E3/E2). No major rooms appear fully omitted, and no entirely new rooms are added, but the foyer/passage segmentation shown in 2D is not structurally preserved (E1/E2)."

    "notes": "Beds, sofa seating, dining table, and kitchen counters are broadly consistent with the 2D intent. However, furniture is not a reliable match to the plan’s depicted arrangement (extra seating/side furniture appears near the deck/living edge not indicated in 2D) (E5). Some items look oversized relative to circulation (e.g., dining area clearance/corridor widths) (E4)."

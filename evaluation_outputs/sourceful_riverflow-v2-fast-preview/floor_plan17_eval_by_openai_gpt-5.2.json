The render shows a simplified cluster of similar-sized rooms around corridors, with major plan-defining spaces absent. Door locations and openings do not correspond to the plan, and window placement appears generic rather than plan-driven. Room proportions are heavily distorted (no large living area; bedrooms/corridors appear resized/rebalanced)."

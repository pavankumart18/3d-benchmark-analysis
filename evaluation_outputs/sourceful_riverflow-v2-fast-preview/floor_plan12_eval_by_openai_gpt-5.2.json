Activity/living area and balcony are roughly in the correct left-side zone, but the stair location/zone does not match the plan (plan shows stairs within/adjacent to Activity at upper-left; render shows stair volume at upper-center/right). Wet-area core differs: plan has separate BATH and separate WC; render appears to combine/blur these into a single bathroom zone. Bedroom placement is inconsistent: the render shows an additional bedroom-like room at the lower-left with an exterior window, which is not present in the plan, and the right-side bedroom arrangement does not cleanly match BED 3 vs BED 4 positions. Several door openings do not align with the plan\u2019s central hall door positions and swing logic. Window runs are also inconsistent (e.g., long clerestory-style window bands in the render don\u2019t match the plan\u2019s window locations/lengths). Overall room proportions/footprint not preserved (notches/recesses and corridor widths differ)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness looks fairly consistent in the render, but core architectural relationships deviate: the plan\u2019s separate WC room is missing/merged, and built-in elements (ROBEs/linen/recess/AC zones) are largely absent or not represented correctly. Adjacency is partially correct (activity next to balcony; bedrooms generally on right/bottom), but the render introduces an extra enclosed room and shifts the stair core. Outer wall shape and internal partitions do not faithfully follow the 2D wall alignment, indicating structural re-interpretation rather than translation."

Beds appear in rooms that do not correspond cleanly to BED2/BED3/BED4 positions. Scale is plausible, but because rooms are incorrect/misaligned, furniture placement accuracy is low."

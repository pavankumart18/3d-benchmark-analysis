Door embedding is incorrect for numerous doors, showing gaps or improper fitting. Adjacency relationships are mostly preserved but distorted due to wall and door errors. The 'Recess' area is entirely missing. Part of the 'Balcony' is not rendered structurally as per the plan (missing wall and balustrade extension). There are no hallucinated rooms, but major structural elements like the '13c high capped wall' and the external wall 'WALL TO 21C AFL' are not represented."

Furniture scale consistency is poor, with some items appearing oversized relative to the rooms. The 'Robe' areas are not properly rendered as built-in wardrobes, rather just empty spaces or simple wall protrusions."

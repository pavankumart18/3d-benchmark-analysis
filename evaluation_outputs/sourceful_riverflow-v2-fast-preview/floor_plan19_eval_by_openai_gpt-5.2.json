(E2/E4) Bedroom-to-toilet/deck relationships are not consistently preserved (top-right suite area appears simplified). (E1/E2) Several small rooms (multiple toilets + HO) are not clearly represented as distinct enclosed spaces, altering circulation. (E2/E3) Door locations/orientations are not faithfully matched (many openings appear generic without matching the 2D door positions and swings). (E2) Window placements from the plan (numerous exterior windows) are largely absent/unclear in the 3D model. (E4) Room proportions look compressed/normalized (living/dining and kitchen/utility appear re-proportioned compared to the labeled dimensions)."

(E1) Not all toilets shown in 2D are represented as separate enclosed bathrooms in 3D (plan indicates multiple: Toi-1, Toi-4, C.Toi, and an additional small toilet). (E1) HO (home office) room is not clearly present as a distinct room. (E2) Adjacency fidelity is weakened where service core partitions (toilets/utility/HO) are merged or rearranged. (E6) Wall thickness/door embedding appears inconsistent (some openings read as gaps without proper framed doors). (E5) Some internal wall runs/corridor edges appear added/reshaped to suit the 3D layout rather than matching the 2D partition geometry."

(E2) Living/dining furniture placement does not clearly match the plan\u2019s layout (sofa/TV/center table positioning differs). (E4) Scale consistency is mixed: several rooms appear to use similarly sized bed/furniture footprints despite differing room dimensions in the plan."

(E6) Some geometry reads softened/simplified (edges and openings not crisply defined). Camera is broadly isometric but not perfectly orthographic-accurate relative to the plan. Overall composition is clear, but fidelity issues reduce technical quality."

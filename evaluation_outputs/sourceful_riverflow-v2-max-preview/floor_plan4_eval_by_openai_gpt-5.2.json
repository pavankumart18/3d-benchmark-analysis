(E2) Bedroom placements do not match: the plan shows Bedroom 1 at top-right and Bedroom 2 mid-right; the render shows one clear bedroom at the far right and another bed/room-like space near the bottom-center that does not correspond to Bedroom 2\u2019s planned position. (E2) Bathroom position/shape appears altered (plan: bottom center-right with tub; render: bathroom zone reads more bottom-center with different internal partitioning; tub not clearly represented). (E3) Multiple interior door positions and swing orientations differ from the plan (hall-to-bedroom/bath/laundry). (E2) Window count/locations do not align: plan has specific perimeter window placements per room; render uses larger/continuous windows along top/right that do not match the plan. (E4) Room proportions are not preserved (hall and living/bedroom areas appear rebalanced relative to stated plan sizes)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent and clean in the render, but plan fidelity is weak. (E2) Adjacency relationships are partially broken: Bedroom 2 should be adjacent to the hall on the right side; in the render the secondary sleeping area is not in the correct adjacency/location. (E1) Closets are missing or not represented correctly (plan includes a closet near laundry and a closet near bathroom/hall; render does not clearly show these as separate enclosed closets with doors). (E5) Extra/ambiguous sleeping area (a bed placed near bottom-center) suggests a hallucinated room/function or a misassigned Bedroom 2. (E2/E3) Door embedding/locations are inconsistent with the plan (notably at entry and bedroom/bathroom connections)."

(E2) Bedroom furniture distribution does not match Bedroom 1 vs Bedroom 2 locations.

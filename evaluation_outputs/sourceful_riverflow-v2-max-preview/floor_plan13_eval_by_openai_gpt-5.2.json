Left zone in plan is Lounge/Dining with balcony; in the 3D render the left side appears subdivided differently and contains bedroom-like furnishing (bed), indicating incorrect room assignment/placement (E2/E5). The right-side bedroom wing exists but internal partitioning and corridor/door locations do not clearly match the 2D wall/door diagram (E2/E3). Window locations/counts do not align with the plan (notably missing/relocated openings for balcony/living and bedroom walls) (E2). Overall proportions/footprint differ from the compact plan plus detached garage; the render reads as a longer continuous volume (E4)."

Key adjacency relationships are not preserved (e.g., lounge/dining to balcony; kitchen/laundry/robe cluster; bath and separate WC arrangement) (E2). Required elements from plan are missing (detached garage; balcony; likely the distinct WC room) (E1). Additional/altered rooming is suggested by an apparent extra sleeping room on the left side not present in the plan (E5)."

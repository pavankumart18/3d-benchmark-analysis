        "notes": "Room placement is mostly correct, but the overall dimensions for the kitchen/dining/living area are too compressed. Wall alignment has several inaccuracies, particularly for the bathroom walls, the wall separating Rachel's bedroom from the coat closet/bathroom, and the wall separating Monica's bedroom from the living room. Door placement and orientation issues are numerous, especially for the main entrance door, kitchen door, and bathroom doors. Window placements are largely missing or inaccurate. Room proportions are distorted, most notably in the living/dining/kitchen area which appears significantly smaller, and the bedrooms feel slightly compressed."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is inconsistent, with some walls appearing thicker than others without reason. Door embeddings are incorrect, with many doors being missing entirely or improperly recessed. Adjacency relationships are disturbed due to misplaced walls and missing doors. Several rooms are missing or heavily altered (e.g., the coat closet, specific bathroom layouts, the closet in Monica's bedroom, the closet near the main entrance). No hallucinated rooms were detected, but significant parts of rooms are altered."

The dining table and chairs are present but scaled differently. The sofa in the living room is present, but the chaise lounge is missing. The small table with chairs in the kitchen is also entirely missing. Furniture scale consistency is poor due to proportional distortions of the rooms."

        "notes": "Isometric camera correctness is fair, but the angle feels a bit too low. Orthographic projection accuracy is difficult to assess purely from this angle, but depth perception seems inconsistent in places. Lighting quality is flat and lacks definition. Geometry is clean for the most part, but there are some visible gaps and irregular edges (e.g., around missing windows). Visual clarity and composition are moderate, but the lack of detail and poor lighting reduce overall aesthetic appeal."

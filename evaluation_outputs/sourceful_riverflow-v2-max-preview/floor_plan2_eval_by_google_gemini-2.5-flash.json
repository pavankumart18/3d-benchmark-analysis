Wall alignments show some discrepancies, particularly in the lower left section. Door placement and orientation are incorrect for several doors, especially in the bathroom and the lower left area. Window placement is generally poor; many windows from the 2D plan are missing, and some are misplaced. Room proportions are distorted in several areas, particularly the bathroom and the upper right bedroom which appears larger."

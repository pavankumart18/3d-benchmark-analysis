(E1) The large DECK along the top edge is not modeled as an outdoor/terrace space; the 3D shows a continuous interior edge/wall instead. (E1) Bedroom-1 side balcony and Bedroom-2 balcony are not present. (E2/E4) Corridor/lobby geometry and several room proportions appear altered (living span and lobby width feel expanded/flattened relative to the plan). (E2) Wet-area placements do not cleanly match the 2D: the left-side toilet cluster (Toilet-3/Toilet-4) reads reconfigured, and the top-right toilet (Toilet-2) appears shifted/reshaped. Door swings/orientations are largely not represented, making correct door placement unverifiable and likely incorrect (E2/E3). Window placement does not reflect the plan\u2019s balcony/deck openings and exterior glazing distribution (E2)."

(E1) No modeled DECK and no modeled BALCONIES (both are structural/space elements in the plan). (E2) Adjacency fidelity is weakened: Living/Dining should open to the DECK; Bedroom-2 should open to its balcony; Bedroom-1 should open to its balcony\u2014these transitions are absent/converted into flat exterior walls. (E2/E3) Door embedding is inconsistent/unclear (several openings lack explicit door placement/swing), so the plan\u2019s door positions cannot be confirmed and likely deviate. (E5) Some internal partitions/niches appear introduced or reshaped without clear correspondence to the plan (notably around the central service band near kitchen/utility/toilets)."

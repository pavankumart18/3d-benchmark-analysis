The 2D shows a large DINING ROOM spanning the lower portion with a distinct WINDOW SEAT/bay condition on the right edge, plus a KITCHEN + PANTRY + UTILITY ROOM + small WC clustered above; the 3D render instead presents a more generic multi-room arrangement with different room boundaries and no clear dining/kitchen zoning matching the plan (E2/E4). Wall alignments do not correspond to the plan\u2019s long continuous walls and offsets (E2). Door locations/orientations do not match the plan\u2019s door swings and openings (E2/E3). Window placement and counts do not match the plan\u2019s specific exterior openings and the window-seat geometry (E2/E1). Proportions of the large dining/kitchen areas are not preserved (E4)."

Multiple labeled spaces from the plan are not clearly present as distinct rooms (CENTRAL HALL, PANTRY, WINDOW SEAT, ALCOVE, crawlspace access zone) (E1). The 3D appears to introduce additional partitions/rooms not indicated in the provided plan segment (E5). Wall thickness looks visually uniform but does not reflect plan-specific structural wall conditions (limited evidence) and door embeddings are generic/non-matching to the plan\u2019s openings (E2)."

        "notes": "Major layout mismatch vs plan. The 2D plan shows one large open kitchen (top-left) connected to dining (top-right) and living (right) with a stair zone (bottom-left) and a tiny central bathroom. The 3D render instead introduces multiple enclosed rooms/corridors on the left/bottom-left, breaking the open-plan arrangement. The stair block shown in the plan is not represented. Entrance position and internal circulation do not align with the plan. Room proportions and overall partitioning are substantially different."

Scales appear generally plausible, but mapping to the correct rooms is largely invalid due to room hallucinations."

Lighting is serviceable but flat. Composition is readable, yet accuracy is undermined by indistinct edges and blurred interior elements."

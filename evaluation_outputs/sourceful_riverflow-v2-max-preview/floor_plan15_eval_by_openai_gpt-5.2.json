        "notes": "Overall footprint and circulation do not match the long, linear 2D plan. The 3D model appears more compact and re-arranged, with corridor/room placements deviating from the central Living & Dining + two side wings layout. Balcony locations shown in plan (central living balcony and master bedroom balcony) are not clearly represented in the 3D. Multiple toilet locations shown in the 2D plan are not consistently present/placed in the 3D. Window count/positions along the exterior walls are significantly reduced/shifted versus plan. Room proportions (especially the long living/dining span and the right-side kitchen/utility band) are not preserved."

        "notes": "Adjacency relationships diverge: in the plan, Kitchen+Utility are grouped on the right with a passage connection to Living/Dining, while the 3D does not clearly maintain this banded right-side service zone. Several wet areas (toilets/powder) shown in plan appear missing or merged in the 3D. Balconies appear missing or not structurally formed as per plan. Some internal partitions/door openings do not align with the expected doorway count/locations from the 2D plan. No strong evidence of consistent wall-thickness logic relative to the plan\u2019s partition hierarchy."

        "notes": "Beds/sofas/tables are present but cannot be mapped reliably to the exact rooms and orientations from the 2D layout due to plan-to-model room reconfiguration. Furniture scale looks broadly plausible, but because several rooms are proportionally distorted, furniture-to-room fit is not faithful to the 2D dimensions."

Geometry is mostly clean, but the model lacks clear definition for key architectural features (balconies, openings) and appears simplified, reducing visual clarity for verification. Not orthographic-accurate to the plan due to re-proportioned massing."

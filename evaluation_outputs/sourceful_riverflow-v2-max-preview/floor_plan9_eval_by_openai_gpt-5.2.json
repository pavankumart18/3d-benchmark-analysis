(E2) Central hall/bath/utility cluster shows shifted wall positions and corridor widths that do not cleanly match the plan\u2019s hall geometry. (E2/E3) Multiple interior door locations/swing orientations in the hall/bedroom wing do not align exactly with the 2D door placements (notably around Bedroom #2/#3 entries and the hall junction). (E2) Window counts/spacing along the long living-room exterior wall appear simplified/altered versus the plan\u2019s repeated window rhythm."

(E2) Door embedding is inconsistent in a few spots (doors appear to open into tighter clearances than the plan indicates, especially in the right-side bedroom wing). (E1) Pantry/closet definition near the kitchen reads under-defined compared to the plan\u2019s clearly labeled PAN enclosure. (E5) Extra/odd short wall returns/closet-like partitions appear in the hall/core that are not clearly present in the 2D plan."

(E2) Kitchen peninsula/working triangle is only loosely matched to the plan\u2019s angled counter run. (E4) Some furniture scales (beds/sofas) read slightly oversized relative to room widths, amplifying the proportion discrepancies (notably the large garage-to-house balance and some bedroom clearances)."

Minor issues: (E6) Slight rendering softness and uniform materials reduce edge definition; some door leaf intersections and wall corners look slightly imprecise. Lighting is adequate but flat, and the render is not strictly orthographic (mild perspective feel). Overall clean and clear, but not highly precise for verification."

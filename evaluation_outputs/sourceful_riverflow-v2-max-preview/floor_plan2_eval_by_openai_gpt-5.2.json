        "notes": "Overall outer footprint and major zones (left bedroom, central hall, living room, kitchen/dining, right/top bedroom) resemble the 2D plan, but there are major interior layout deviations. The dedicated small room between the bathroom and the right-side bedroom (shown with a desk in the 2D plan) is not represented as a separate enclosed space in the 3D render, altering room placement and wall alignment. Several door positions/orientations along the top corridor segment do not clearly match the 2D plan\u2019s swing/locations, and window counts/positions on exterior walls differ from the plan. Central circulation appears over-expanded, distorting proportions of adjoining rooms."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent and doors appear embedded in walls, but adjacency relationships are compromised by the missing/merged top-middle-right room (bathroom-to-bedroom sequencing differs from the plan). The 2D plan indicates a distinct additional room off the corridor (between bath and right bedroom); the 3D effectively merges that function into another space, constituting a missing room. No clearly new/extra rooms are added, but functional re-assignment (desk/office area moved into bedroom) reduces fidelity."

        "notes": "Key furniture categories are present (beds, sofa, dining table, kitchen counters), but placements do not closely follow the 2D plan: the office/desk furniture is relocated (2D shows a separate room; 3D places a desk within the bedroom). Living room seating/TV orientation and some radiator/furnishing placements are not tightly matched. Scale is generally believable, but mapping to the plan is inconsistent due to the missing room."

        "notes": "Isometric view is coherent and readable; lighting is even and geometry is mostly clean with no major mesh tearing. Minor issues: large empty central floor area reduces composition clarity and makes the layout feel less grounded to the 2D plan; projection is not strictly orthographic but is acceptable for an isometric render."

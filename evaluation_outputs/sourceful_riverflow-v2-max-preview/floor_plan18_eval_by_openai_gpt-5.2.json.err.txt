    "score": 18,
    "max": 40,
    "notes": "Overall layout resembles the plan (bedroom left, toilet central-top, kitchen right, living/dining central), but several key spatial deviations exist. The utility space shown on the 2D plan is not represented as a separate room/zone in the 3D. The foyer in the 2D plan is a distinct small entry (bottom-right) but appears merged/opened into the living area in the 3D, altering the entry sequence. Door locations/swing relationships around the toilet/kitchen/entry do not reliably match the 2D plan. Window locations/counts also diverge (notably kitchen and living façade openings). Room proportions appear distorted: living/dining reads oversized relative to the compact foyer and kitchen sizes given in the plan."

  "structural_fidelity": {
    "score": 12,
    "max": 25,
    "notes": "Wall thickness and general wall construction look consistent, and doors are generally embedded cleanly. However, adjacency fidelity is weakened by the missing utility and altered foyer boundary. The 3D introduces an exterior door from the kitchen/right side that is not indicated in the 2D plan, and the utility access from kitchen (a key adjacency) is not preserved. No clear, correctly separated utility enclosure is present."

    "score": 7,
    "max": 10,
    "notes": "Major furniture types are placed in plausible corresponding rooms (bed in bedroom, dining table in living/dining, kitchen counters/appliances). Exact placement does not strictly follow the 2D hints (e.g., living arrangement/TV not specified in plan), but scale appears generally consistent and usable."

    "notes": "Isometric view is clear and well composed with clean geometry and good lighting. Minor issues: projection is slightly perspective-like rather than strict axonometric/orthographic. Visual quality is strong even though architectural fidelity is weak."

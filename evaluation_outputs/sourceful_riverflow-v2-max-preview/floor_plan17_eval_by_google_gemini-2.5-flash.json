Window placements are largely missing or generalized. Room proportions are distorted in several areas, notably the balconies and the utility/service rooms."

Door embedding is poor; many doors are rendered as simple openings without proper frames or flush mounting. Adjacency relationships are mostly preserved for major rooms but are problematic for smaller service areas. Missing rooms include the 'SER. RM' and 'UTILITY' as distinct, properly enclosed spaces.

Lighting quality is poor, resulting in flat, uninteresting visuals and loss of detail due to lack of shadows. Geometry is clean for the main walls but many smaller elements (doors, windows, furniture) are simplistic and lack detail, leading to a 'blocky' appearance. Visual clarity is okay, but composition is uninspired."

        "notes": "Overall layout roughly follows the plan (bedrooms at top, open kitchen/living center-right, garage bottom-right, master zone bottom-left), but several spaces are not placed/defined as in the 2D plan. Activity vs living zoning is blurred: the 3D shows a large open living area and a smaller TV nook, but the plan has a distinct ACTIVITY room centered above KITCHEN and a separate large LIVING to the right. The PANTRY is not shown as a separate enclosed room as per plan. Door locations/swing directions are frequently inconsistent or simplified into open passages (notably bedrooms-to-hall, ensuite/WIR/WC cluster, and entry/study). Windows shown in the 2D (many exterior wall segments) are largely absent or not placed to match; the 3D reads as mostly windowless exterior walls. Proportions appear distorted: garage and central open area read oversized relative to bedrooms/theatre compared to the plan."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent in the render, but fidelity to the plan\u2019s partitioning is reduced: several planned enclosed/service spaces are merged or omitted (PANTRY; master-side WC/WIR definition is unclear). Adjacency is partially correct (beds near bath/laundry; alfresco adjacent to living/activity; garage adjacent to entry zone), but the master suite sublayout (ENSUITE + separate WC + WIR) does not match clearly. No strong evidence of an added (hallucinated) extra room, but multiple internal walls/door embeds are simplified, changing circulation compared to the plan."

Scale feels off in places (garage and open living zone oversized relative to bedroom furnishings)."

However, it is more a stylized perspective/isometric render than an orthographic-accurate architectural isometric: openings/windows are under-modeled, and some wall junctions/recesses from the plan are not represented, reducing technical clarity."

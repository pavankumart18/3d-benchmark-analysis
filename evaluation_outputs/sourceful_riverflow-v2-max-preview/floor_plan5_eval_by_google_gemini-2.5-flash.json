Door embeddings are incorrect due to missing and misplaced doors. Adjacency relationships are mostly maintained, but the connection between the central living space and the bathroom on the right is altered due to a missing door. No hallucinated rooms were identified, but a door is missing for a room. One entry area with outdoor seating on the bottom is missing from the 3D render."

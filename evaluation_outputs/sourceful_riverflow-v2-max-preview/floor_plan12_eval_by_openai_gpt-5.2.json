The balcony is repositioned (render shows it centered/bottom with broad glazing access, whereas plan places balcony bottom-left off the Activity room). The stair/recess zone at the top-left of the plan is not represented, altering the entire left-side volume. Bath/WC configuration does not match the plan\u2019s two distinct rooms. Multiple window/slider locations and lengths do not align with the plan, and room proportions (especially Activity vs. balcony relationship and bedroom openings) appear distorted."

        "notes": "Key programmed elements are missing (stair/recess, linen, built-in robes) and the wet-area partitioning differs from plan intent (separate Bath and WC not faithfully modeled). Adjacencies are partially preserved (three bedrooms generally on the right and wet core near center), but the balcony adjacency and left-side massing are incorrect. No clear additional full rooms beyond the plan, but significant openings/glazing and wall runs appear invented or over-extended relative to the 2D drawing."

The Activity room is furnished as a living/lounge with a sofa rather than reflecting the plan\u2019s intended activity space configuration. Balcony furniture shown in plan is not represented. Some furniture scaling feels generic relative to room sizes."

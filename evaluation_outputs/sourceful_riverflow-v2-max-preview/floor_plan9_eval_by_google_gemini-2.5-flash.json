Wall alignment shows inconsistencies, especially in the kitchen area, dining room, and the master bedroom/master bath. Several doors are missing (e.g., to the Study, Bedroom #4), misplaced (e.g., Hall to Bath), or have incorrect orientations (e.g., Master Bedroom to Master Bath, Living Room to Covered Patio). Window placements are inconsistent; some are missing or incorrectly sized/placed. Room proportions are distorted in many areas, notably the Nook, Study, and the covered patio area."

Adjacency relationships are mostly preserved, but the significant distortion of the Study and the adjacent covered patio impacts this score. Many rooms are missing doors (e.g., Study, Bedroom #4). No overtly hallucinated rooms, but the distortion of existing rooms is significant."

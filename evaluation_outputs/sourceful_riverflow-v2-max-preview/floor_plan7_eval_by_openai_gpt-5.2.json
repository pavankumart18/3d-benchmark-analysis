        "notes": "Dining, kitchen, living, and bedroom are generally in the correct quadrants, but several key spatial relationships deviate from the 2D plan. The stair zone is not placed/enclosed as a distinct bottom-right annex like the plan, and the central circulation reads differently (hall/corridor geometry is altered). The bathroom core does not clearly preserve the plan\u2019s split Wash Area vs Toilet layout and their exact positions. Entrance placement/transition into the living area does not match the plan\u2019s top-right entry configuration. Window locations/quantity differ noticeably around multiple exterior walls. Overall room sizes/ratios appear shifted (kitchen and central open area oversized relative to bedroom/bath core)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent, but internal partitioning differs around the wash/toilet core and stair enclosure. Door embedding exists but several doors are not where the plan indicates (notably entry and service/core doors). Adjacencies are partially preserved (dining near kitchen; living near entry), but the stair annex relationship to the living/circulation is structurally altered. The plan\u2019s distinct Wash Area is not faithfully represented as a separate room. Additional/exaggerated exterior access/landing elements appear that are not in the 2D plan."

However, furniture positioning does not strictly follow the 2D symbols (living seating arrangement/orientation differs; bathroom fixtures arrangement doesn\u2019t clearly match the split wash/toilet depiction). Some scale relationships feel off due to enlarged circulation/kitchen areas."

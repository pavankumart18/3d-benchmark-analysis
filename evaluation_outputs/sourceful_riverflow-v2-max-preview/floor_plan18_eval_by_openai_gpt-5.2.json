Wall jogs/indentations on the right/top (utility/duct region) are not faithfully reproduced, and key area proportions (foyer vs living vs kitchen) appear altered. Door and window positions partially match but not consistently."

Most rooms shown connect plausibly, yet at least one required room/zone is missing and some partitions appear reinterpreted."

However, placement does not closely follow the 2D layout (e.g., living seating/TV arrangement and balcony interface), and some item scales/clearances look idealized rather than plan-true."

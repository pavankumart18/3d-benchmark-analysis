Noticeable room proportion drift (living area oversized relative to bedrooms/hall; left service zone compressed)."

        "notes": "Wall network is simplified and several partitions do not follow the 2D wall jogs (notably the left-side bathroom/coat/closet cluster and the hall). Adjacency is partially preserved (kitchen next to dining/living; bedrooms separated), but the exact closet/coat storage relationships are not faithfully reproduced. Door embeddings/openings appear inconsistent with the plan (hall-to-living opening, bath doors, bedroom doors). Likely missing or materially altered closet/coat storage spaces; no clear evidence of an added full extra room, but several elements read as non-plan partitions."

Scale reads plausible overall, but several items (kitchen run/peninsula and living seating group) do not align to the 2D proportions."

Geometry is mostly clean, but some walls/edges look softened and simplified, which hurts clarity for verification. Projection is not strictly orthographic (reads like mild perspective isometric)."

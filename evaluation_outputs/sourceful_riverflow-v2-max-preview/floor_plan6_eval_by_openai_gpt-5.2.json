        "notes": "Overall zoning is roughly correct (open Kitchen/Living on the left, Bedroom on upper-right, stair zone on far right), but multiple interior partitions do not match the 2D plan. The 3D introduces curved corridor walls and reshapes the central core, causing misalignment of walls and incorrect circulation. Several door locations/openings between Living\u2194hall/bedroom and within the bathroom/closet core do not correspond to the plan. Window layout is significantly simplified compared to the plan, and room proportions (especially the central service core vs. surrounding spaces) appear distorted."

        "notes": "The 2D plan has a rectilinear service core (bathroom + adjacent small rooms/closets) with specific adjacencies; the 3D reconfigures this area and adds non-plan geometry (curved walls), reducing fidelity. Door embeddings are inconsistent (several plan doors are missing or replaced by open passages). Some required small rooms/closet-like spaces appear merged/altered, and the external wall/window pattern is not preserved. No clear evidence of all plan-indicated openings and partitions being maintained."

Kitchen elements (counters/island) are simplified and not clearly matching the plan\u2019s exact L-shape/fixtures. Scale is generally consistent, but mapping accuracy to the 2D symbols is low."

        "notes": "Lighting is clean and the model is visually coherent with mostly clean geometry. However, the camera is not a strict architectural/isometric verification view (more perspective than true orthographic/isometric), reducing measurability. Some geometry choices (curved walls) read as design artifacts relative to the plan, and the lack of window/door detail reduces clarity for verification."

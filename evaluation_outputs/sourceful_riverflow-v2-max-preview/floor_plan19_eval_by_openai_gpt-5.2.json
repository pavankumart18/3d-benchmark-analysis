Several major room locations appear only approximately clustered (living zone left, bedrooms around), but internal wall layout and circulation do not align well with the plan. Door locations/orientations are not faithfully represented (openings are unclear and do not correspond to the plan\u2019s specific door positions), and window/door-to-deck placement on the north/top side is largely missing. Room proportions are not preserved (living/dining and bedroom bay sizes/offsets appear compressed and rebalanced)."

Multiple small service spaces (utility/toilets/foyer/store/HO) are either missing or merged into ambiguous partitions. Wall thickness appears inconsistent and many walls read as soft/blurred masses, reducing confidence in correct wall/door embedding. Several planned rooms/spaces are absent, and the render also introduces ambiguous corridor-like partitions that do not clearly exist in the 2D layout."

Bed placements exist, but room-specific furniture arrangements (living seating composition, dining orientation, and built-ins) are not faithfully mapped. Some furniture appears underspecified and scale is inconsistent due to the blurred geometry."

Lighting is flat but not severely broken. Clean-geometry score is reduced due to apparent rendering artifacts and indistinct interior partitions. Composition is adequate but not informative for architectural fidelity."

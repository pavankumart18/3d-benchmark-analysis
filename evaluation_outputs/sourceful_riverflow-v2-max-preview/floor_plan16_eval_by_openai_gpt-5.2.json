The small shaft/duct shown to the right of Toilet-1 in the 2D plan is not represented as an open shaft and appears enclosed/usable in 3D (E5/E2). Door locations are not faithfully reproduced: the bathroom and bedroom access points appear shifted relative to the plan\u2019s short passage alignment (E2), and the balcony opening/threshold does not clearly match the plan\u2019s balcony edge/entry position (E2). Proportions are off: Toilet/wardrobe zone and the central passage read wider in 3D than in plan; living area depth vs bedroom width appears distorted (E4). Window placement is inconsistent: the 3D shows large continuous glazing on the bedroom exterior and additional window placements that do not clearly correspond to the plan\u2019s specific openings (E2)."

Door embedding/orientation is inconsistent with the 2D swing placements, especially around the toilet/bedroom junction (E2/E3). Wall thickness looks somewhat uniform, but several partitions appear re-positioned or thickened, changing the corridor/room boundaries (E4). No major primary room is fully missing, but the plan\u2019s non-occupiable duct element is not correctly modeled (E2/E5)."

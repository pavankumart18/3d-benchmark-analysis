Doors are generalized and do not match the 2D plan\u2019s exact positions/orientations (notably around dining-to-bedroom corridor and bathroom entries) (E2/E3). Window placement is largely absent/unsupported in the 3D (most exterior walls show no clear windows where the 2D plan indicates multiple window openings) (E2). Room proportions appear distorted: living/dining read as more open/merged than the plan\u2019s defined boundaries, and bedroom/bathroom sizes look normalized rather than matching the annotated dimensions (E4)."

        "notes": "Adjacency is partially correct (bedrooms clustered right; kitchen/utility left), but service/toilet cluster fidelity is weak. The 2D plan contains multiple small toilets (powder/common and attached) and a dress + two-toilet master suite arrangement; the 3D does not clearly preserve the full count and separation of these small rooms (likely missing or merged) (E1/E4). Door embedding looks inconsistent (some openings read as wall gaps without clear frames/swing logic compared to the plan) (E6/E3). No strong evidence of hallucinated new rooms, but several plan-defined micro-spaces are not faithfully represented."

Dining set appears present but scale and clearance do not reflect the tighter plan geometry, suggesting inconsistent scaling relative to rooms (E4). Bedrooms have beds placed, but positions/orientations do not consistently match the 2D bed locations."

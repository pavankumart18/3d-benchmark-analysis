The 3D render depicts a different spatial program (appears as 3 bedrooms) and does not preserve the deck/balcony geometry. Doors and windows do not align with the 2D plan’s exterior openings (notably the missing deck/sliding-door edges), and room proportions (living/dining vs bedrooms) are distorted due to the extra room(s). Errors: E1, E2, E3, E4, E5."

    "notes": "Some basic wall construction is clean and consistent, but the unit’s structural intent is not faithfully reproduced: missing both decks and the utility space, and an extra bedroom is introduced. Adjacency relationships are incorrect (rooms/baths do not match the plan’s connections to foyer/living and bed-1/bed-2). Door embeddings exist but are placed in the wrong walls relative to the 2D plan. Errors: E1, E2, E5."

However, it is not a true plan-faithful isometric/orthographic representation of the provided 2D layout, and perspective/proportional cues do not support verification. Minor simplifications/omissions reduce clarity for architectural matching. Errors: E6 (minor), E4 (perceptual distortion vs plan)."

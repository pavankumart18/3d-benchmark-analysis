Window placements in the bedroom and utility room differ significantly from the floor plan. Room proportions, especially in the kitchen/utility area, are noticeably distorted, as is the bedroom. The living/dining area entrance is also incorrect. The partition wall between the living/dining and bedroom is thicker than indicated on the floor plan, affecting room proportions."

The wall thickness for the bedroom/living area partition is inconsistent, appearing thicker in the 3D render. The entire toilet room seems to be missing in the 3D render. The wall between the kitchen and utility room is incorrect, and the utility room overall shape is distorted. The area identified as 'toilet-1' in the 2D plan is represented differently, appearing more as a utility room continuation in the 3D, and the specific toilet layout from the plan is absent."

Bedroom furniture, especially the wardrobe, is different in type and placement. The bathroom fixtures are completely missing as the room itself seems to be missing. Balcony planter boxes are present but changed. Living area furniture is generally similar in type but layout differs slightly."

However, the scene lacks realistic lighting, appearing flat and without shadows, which reduces overall visual clarity and appeal. The composition is standard but could be enhanced with better lighting."

        "notes": "Living/dining, kitchen, utility, bedroom, and balcony are generally in the correct quadrants, but the wet-core area is wrong. Toilet-1 shown in the 2D plan (between utility and bedroom zone) is not represented as a proper room in the 3D. The top-right block is rendered as a large wardrobe/closet-like space instead of the toilet/duct arrangement from the plan. Balcony opening appears as a wide slider in 3D (acceptable), but bedroom exterior opening/window placement does not match the plan (render shows large glazing on the bottom/right edge inconsistent with the 2D). Room proportions for the service zone (utility/toilet) are distorted due to the missing toilet and enlarged storage area."

        "notes": "Wall thickness looks mostly consistent and geometry is coherent, but adjacency/partitioning differs from the 2D: the toilet should be adjacent under the utility zone and accessible from the central passage/living side; in 3D that enclosure is absent, breaking key adjacency relationships. Doors for toilet are missing, and the entry door at the top-left is not clearly embedded/located as shown in plan (appears as an open gap rather than the defined swing door). A hallucinated/expanded closet room occupies space where the toilet/shaft should be."

        "notes": "Living area sofa/coffee table and dining table placement roughly align with the 2D concept, and the kitchen/utility appliances are plausible. However, toilet fixtures (WC/vanity) are missing entirely. Some added furniture (e.g., large wardrobe/cabinet massing in top-right) does not correspond to the 2D layout and affects functional mapping. Overall furniture scale is acceptable but not faithful to the missing bathroom program."

Geometry is generally clean with no major mesh artifacts. Composition is good, but fidelity issues (missing bathroom, incorrect openings) reduce architectural credibility despite decent rendering quality."

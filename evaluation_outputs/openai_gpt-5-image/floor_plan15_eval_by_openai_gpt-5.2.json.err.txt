    "notes": "Overall layout is only partially consistent: living/dining is generally central and bedrooms are roughly left/center/right, but several key spaces/openings diverge. The central (living) balcony shown on the 2D plan is not modeled as a balcony in the 3D (replaced by a window) (E1/E2). Bedroom-1 placement/footprint appears shifted relative to the plan’s top-left/central positioning and its relationship to the left-side passage/toilet cluster (E2). Multiple doors are missing or placed differently than the plan (notably toilet/room connections) and door swing/orientation is not consistently represented (E2/E3). Window count/placement on external walls is simplified and does not match the plan’s openings, especially around living/balcony and kitchen/utility side (E2). Room sizes/proportions appear altered (living zone enlarged; passages/ancillary spaces compressed) (E4)."

    "notes": "Wall thickness looks fairly consistent in the render, but the plan’s full partitioning is not faithfully reproduced. Adjacencies are partially correct (kitchen on right, living central, bedrooms distributed), but key adjacency elements are wrong/missing: the living room should open to a balcony at the top; instead it terminates at a wall with a window (E1/E2). Utility room attached to kitchen (right side) is not clearly present as a distinct enclosed space (E1). One of the plan’s toilets (left-side cluster near Bedroom-1 / passage) is not represented, resulting in fewer bathrooms than the 2D plan (E1). No clearly hallucinated extra rooms, but some partitions appear invented/simplified compared to the plan’s detailed passage/toilet layout (E5)."

    "notes": "Furniture is generic and not mapped to the 2D plan (which does not specify this exact arrangement). Some placements are plausible (beds in bedrooms; dining near living), but the kitchen counter/peninsula arrangement appears invented rather than derived from the plan (E5). Scale is mostly believable, though circulation clearances look inconsistent with the narrow passage widths shown in 2D (E4)."

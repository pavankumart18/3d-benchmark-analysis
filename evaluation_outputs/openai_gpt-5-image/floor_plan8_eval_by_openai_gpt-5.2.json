(E2/E4) Kitchen footprint and perimeter wall breaks do not match the plan\u2019s stepped right-side exterior and the kitchen/playroom separation line. (E2/E3) Several interior door locations/orientations don\u2019t correspond to the 2D door swings (notably the kitchen\u2013dining connection and the small service spaces near foyer/WC).

(E5) Extra/unsupported exterior door configuration appears in 3D (prominent double-door on right/front side is not clearly indicated in the plan). Wall thickness is generally consistent, but several walls are shifted/straightened relative to the plan\u2019s offsets."

(E2/E4) Living & dining zone in 3D does not read as the long central 3.65x6.97 space connecting to both passages/balcony; it appears reshaped and more compact with a large empty front area. (E2/E3) Several internal door locations/orientations do not match the plan\u2019s passage-driven circulation (doors to toilets/bedrooms appear simplified/shifted). (E2) Window locations/count do not match the plan\u2019s extensive external openings; balcony-side openings are not represented correctly. (E4) Room proportions (living/dining length, corridor widths, kitchen depth) appear distorted relative to the annotated plan."

(E1) Balconies shown on the plan (living balcony and master balcony) are not modeled as balcony spaces. (E1) Utility space adjacent to kitchen is missing. (E1) Plan indicates multiple toilets (including a powder toilet); 3D shows fewer wet rooms than required. (E2) Adjacency/circulation via the two 'wide passages' is not faithfully reproduced; walls/doorways appear rearranged. Wall thickness/door embedding are generally consistent but not enough to compensate for missing spaces."

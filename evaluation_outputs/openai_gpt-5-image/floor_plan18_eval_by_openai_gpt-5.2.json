The 2D has a distinct FOYER (bottom-right) before entering Living/Dining; in 3D the entry reads as opening directly into the Living/Dining with no clear foyer enclosure (E1/E2). Kitchen-Utility-Toilet cluster on the right/top-right does not match the 2D wall breaks and door locations (E2). Bedroom window placement is incorrect (2D shows a window on the bedroom's left/exterior wall; 3D places a window on the top wall) (E2). Several door positions/orientations do not align with the 2D plan (toilet/utility/bedroom access offsets) (E2/E3). Room proportions appear distorted: Living/Dining is oversized relative to Bedroom vs the stated 10'x13' and 10'x12' relationship; Kitchen appears expanded relative to 7'6\"x8'6\" (E4)."

Utility access appears mis-modeled (in 2D it is accessed from Kitchen; in 3D it reads as accessed via a different doorway/zone and includes an exterior-style door) (E2/E5). Window/vent openings for toilet/utility do not match the plan (E1/E2). Wall thickness looks fairly consistent, but door embedding and wall alignment around the right-side core deviate from the 2D geometry (E2)."

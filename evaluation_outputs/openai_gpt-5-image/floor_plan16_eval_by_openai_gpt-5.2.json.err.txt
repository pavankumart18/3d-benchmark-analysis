    "notes": "Major plan-to-render mismatch in the service core: the bathroom/toilet shown in the 2D plan is not represented as a toilet in the 3D layout, and the right-side block is reorganized. Living/dining + kitchen + utility are generally in the expected quadrant, but internal partitions, door locations, and bedroom opening/window locations do not reliably match the plan. Bedroom bed orientation and glazing positions indicate notable spatial deviation and proportion drift."

    "notes": "Wall thickness and general perimeter continuity are acceptable, but key functional structure is incorrect: the toilet room is missing as a toilet, adjacency relationships around the wet area (utility/toilet/bedroom) do not match, and an extra enclosed room/zone appears where the plan shows toilet/closet alignment. Doorways that do exist are cleanly embedded, but several planned doors are absent or relocated due to the altered partitioning."

    "notes": "Living/dining furniture conceptually matches (sofa + table), and kitchen/utility appliances roughly correspond. However, bedroom furniture orientation differs from the plan (bed rotated), and added elements (TV console/desk placement) do not clearly map to the 2D plan. Overall scale is plausible but mapping accuracy is weak."

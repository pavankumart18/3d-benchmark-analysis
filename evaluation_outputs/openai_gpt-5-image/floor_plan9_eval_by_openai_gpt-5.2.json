        "notes": "Overall layout resembles the plan (garage at bottom-right, large living/kitchen to left, bedroom wing to right), but multiple spatial mismatches are present. Living room window wall shows an incorrect count/spacing vs plan (extra/misaligned openings). Covered patio areas from the plan are not modeled as distinct exterior/covered spaces, affecting major adjacency cues. Several interior door locations/orientations do not match the plan (notably study entry style and some hall/bedroom openings). Room proportions are distorted: living area appears oversized relative to adjacent rooms, and the central hall/utility/bath cluster geometry does not preserve the plan\u2019s clear corridor widths and offsets."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is generally consistent, but key architectural elements from the plan are missing or simplified (both covered patios not represented as defined spaces; several openings appear shifted). Some adjacency relationships are weakened by altered partitions in the central hall/service core (bath/utility/bedroom #4 zone) and by the simplified nook/patio connection. No obvious fully hallucinated new rooms, but several partitions/doors/windows appear invented or relocated relative to the 2D plan."

Scale of the shown kitchen elements is plausible, but the overall interior is largely unfurnished compared to the plan\u2019s fixture intent."

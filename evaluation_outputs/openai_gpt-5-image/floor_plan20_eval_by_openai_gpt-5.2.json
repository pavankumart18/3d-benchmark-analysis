(E1/E2) Kitchen + attached Utility zone (bottom-center/right in plan) are not represented as a distinct room cluster in 3D; central space reads as continuous living/dining. (E2) Bathroom/toilet block locations and their relationship to bedrooms/corridor do not match plan (left-side toilets and central/right toilet appear re-partitioned). (E2/E3) Door locations and orientations are largely incorrect/undefined (most openings have no clear hinged orientation matching the plan). (E4) Room proportions differ: living/dining area is expanded; service core (kitchen/utility/lobby) is compressed/absent; corridors/wall runs do not align to the plan."

(E2) Adjacencies are wrong: plan\u2019s kitchen/utility/toilet-1 sequence on the bottom/right side is not maintained; deck adjacency to living is missing. (E1) Missing deck and missing/merged service rooms violate completeness. (E5) Several openings/windows appear added or resized without plan basis. Wall thickness is somewhat consistent visually, but door embedding is not faithful (many door leaves omitted)."

Bedroom furniture is generic and not scaled/placed to match the 2D layout."

Some clarity issues arise from missing door swings/frames and simplified openings, which reduces architectural legibility. Overall presentation quality is moderate despite fidelity issues."

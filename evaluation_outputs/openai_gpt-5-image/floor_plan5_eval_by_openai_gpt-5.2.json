The plan\u2019s distinct room blocks on the left/top-left and right side do not match the 3D room placement (E2). Main entry on the bottom side is shown as a double door in 2D but becomes a large arched opening without matching door geometry in 3D (E2/E1). Window positions and counts do not correspond closely to the plan (E2/E5). Central living/dining proportions appear significantly altered (over-enlarged) relative to adjacent rooms (E4)."

Multiple walls in 3D are curved where the plan uses orthogonal straight segments (E5). Door embedding/orientation is inconsistent: many 3D doors are placed generically on walls without matching swing-side and exact openings from 2D (E2/E3). Adjacency fidelity is weak (bath/bed/hall relationships appear rearranged) (E2). At least one bathroom/utility space from the 2D is not clearly present as a properly enclosed room in 3D (E1)."

Bedroom furnishing and kitchen layout do not follow the plan\u2019s fixture/counter shapes closely (E2). Scale is inconsistent (central furniture appears undersized relative to the enlarged central room) (E4)."

Isometric-style camera is acceptable, though reads slightly perspective-biased rather than strictly orthographic/isometric (E6). Geometry is generally clean, but the curved/arched walls and openings introduce stylistic distortions relative to architectural orthogonality (E6/E5). Overall clarity is good."

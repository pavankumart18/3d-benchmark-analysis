    "notes": "Overall massing loosely follows the 2D plan (garage at lower-right, large living space at upper-left, master suite at upper-right), but multiple plan-defining elements are missing or misrepresented. Several doors to exterior spaces are absent, the patio/covered patio zones are not modeled as in plan, bedroom/bath window patterns do not match, and some room shapes (notably master suite + central hall cluster) are distorted vs the 2D geometry."

    "notes": "Wall thickness looks mostly consistent and geometry is generally coherent, but key structural/plan fidelity issues remain: missing exterior patio spaces, missing/incorrect exterior door openings, incorrect/missing window runs on the right elevation, and the master closet/bath block does not match the plan (including an implausible window in the closet area). Central hall/utility/bath partitioning appears altered, creating extra/shifted subspaces."

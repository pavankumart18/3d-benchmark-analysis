Living/dining/kitchen zone is not faithfully arranged: the plan shows an L-shaped kitchen with a larger dining table placement; the 3D shows a small linear kitchenette and undersized dining setup (E2, E4). Several wall offsets/indentations on the left side (bath/coat/closet cluster) do not align to the plan\u2019s stepped wall geometry (E2). Door locations/orientations do not match the plan in multiple places (bedrooms/baths/entry) (E2, E3). Window placement only partially matches: the large living-room window exists but proportion/mullion count/extent do not match the plan\u2019s long run (E4). Room proportions are distorted: living area appears oversized while service rooms/circulation are compressed (E4)."

Adjacency relationships differ: the plan\u2019s entry/foyer and its connections to the central bath and bedrooms are not preserved in the same configuration (E2). Multiple doors appear embedded into different walls than indicated, and several openings are simplified into generic doors (E2, E3). Hallucinated/incorrect fixtures appear (e.g., an exterior sink/vanity-like element placed outside the bathroom in the corridor area that is not shown in the plan) (E5). Overall wall thickness looks visually consistent, but the partition layout fidelity is low."

However, the camera reads slightly perspective rather than strictly orthographic/isometric, and some elements look overly simplified (generic doors, minimal detailing) reducing architectural clarity."

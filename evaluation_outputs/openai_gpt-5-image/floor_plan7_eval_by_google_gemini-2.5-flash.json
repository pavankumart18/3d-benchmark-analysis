The 'Entrance to the House' is not accurately represented, and its connection to the kitchen is incorrect. The staircase is present but its specific 'UP' direction and integration with the lower floor are not clear from the render. The door placements for Bedroom 1, Kitchen, and Living Room are incorrect or missing. Window placements are also incorrect for most rooms."

The internal wall separating the toilet area from the living room is missing. Several doors from the floor plan are missing in the render. Adjacency relationships are therefore incorrect due to missing elements."

The proportions of the furniture generally seem consistent within the rendered rooms, but the absence of several key items negatively impacts placement accuracy."

        "notes": "Major layout mismatches versus plan: the separate Wash Area + Toilet shown in 2D is rendered as a single combined bathroom (E1/E2). The Entrance-to-the-House vestibule at the top-right of the plan is not represented; instead a single exterior door appears on the right side of the living room (E1/E2/E3). Internal circulation/hall geometry is simplified and does not match the plan\u2019s central passage alignment (E2). Room proportions are noticeably altered: living room and stair zone proportions/footprints differ from the plan, with the stair opening/landing reading larger and shifted relative to the plan (E4). Window placements in multiple rooms do not match the plan positions/counts (E2)."

        "notes": "Walls are generally consistent thickness, but core program fidelity is broken: missing Entrance vestibule/foyer (E1) and missing separate Wash Area room (E1). Adjacency is partially preserved (dining-kitchen-bedroom-living roughly in correct quadrants), but the bathroom suite adjacency/partitioning is incorrect (E2). Exterior entry location/orientation does not match the plan (E2/E3). No clear additional (extra) rooms beyond the plan, but the combined bathroom effectively hallucinates a different room configuration (E5)."

Some furniture proportions/spacing appear stylized (e.g., living seating arrangement vs available plan footprint), contributing to minor scale inconsistency (E4)."

However, door/window modeling is inconsistent with the plan (functional clarity issue), and some openings read minimally detailed. Overall composition is clear, but the stair/rail and entry are visually emphasized despite being plan-inaccurate."

        "notes": "Overall room zoning is roughly similar (left bedroom, central hall/bath/utility, right bedroom, open living/dining/kitchen), but multiple spatial mismatches: interior wall runs and offsets don\u2019t match the 2D plan (notably the hall-to-living boundary and the left-side entry corridor shape). Several door locations/orientations are incorrect or simplified, and most exterior windows shown on the 2D plan are missing in the 3D. Room proportions are noticeably distorted: the central open area is enlarged while the top rooms (bath/office) and left bedroom appear resized/reshaped."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent, but adjacency and openings are not faithfully embedded: doors appear as generic panels and do not consistently correspond to the plan\u2019s swing positions. Adjacency is partially preserved (bath and office along the top-middle, bedrooms at left/right), but key partition geometry (living-area enclosure/partial wall) deviates. No clear extra rooms, but several planned architectural elements (windows, some partitions) are omitted, reducing fidelity."

Right bedroom desk/workstation shown in plan is missing/simplified. Living room arrangement differs (plan shows sectional + chair + TV placement within a defined nook; 3D places seating more openly with different partition context). Kitchen layout is simplified and not placed/arranged to match the 2D counters/appliances."

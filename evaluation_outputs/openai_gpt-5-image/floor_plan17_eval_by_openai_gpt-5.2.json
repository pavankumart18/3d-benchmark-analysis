Balcony locations are wrong (render shows a bottom-left terrace/balcony, while plan balconies are at top near Living and Master). Multiple internal walls and corridors are reconfigured, so door openings and circulation do not match. Bedroom and toilet sizes/proportions appear heavily altered vs labeled dimensions."

        "notes": "Overall massing loosely resembles the 2D plan (garage at lower-right; central kitchen zone; living zone on right; bedroom cluster on left), but multiple rooms are repositioned/merged and several circulation/entry spaces are not represented. The master suite is not clearly located at the bottom-left as in plan (a bedroom appears closer to bottom-center). The theatre room location/identity is inconsistent (render shows a generic lounge at bottom-left). Kitchen/pantry geometry is simplified and does not match the plan\u2019s pantry placement. Door locations/orientations are largely not modeled (open wall gaps instead), preventing verification and implying incorrect placements. Window distribution does not match the plan (extra/missing openings and different sizes/locations). Room proportions are noticeably altered (right-side living/dining area enlarged; left-side service/amenity rooms compressed)."

        "notes": "Several labeled plan spaces are missing or collapsed into generic rooms/voids (alfresco, verandah, portico, pantry detail, linen/robes, WIR/ensuite composition). Adjacencies are partially correct at a macro level (kitchen near living; garage adjacent to entry side), but key relationships are wrong/unclear (master suite vs theatre vs study placement; service core of bath/wc/laundry). Many doors are not embedded (render uses open passages), so true door-wall integration and swing/orientation fidelity is not achieved. Wall thickness appears uniform but simplified; internal partitions do not consistently follow the plan."

Scale is generally plausible, but placements imply different room boundaries than the 2D plan."

However, camera is more top-down perspective than a true isometric, and it does not communicate exterior elements (alfresco/verandah/portico) that are essential to the plan. Visual clarity is good, but architectural correctness is undermined by missing doors and oversimplified openings."

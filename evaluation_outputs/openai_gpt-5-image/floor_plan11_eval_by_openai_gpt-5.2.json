E1: Missing Pantry as a distinct enclosed/defined element (render shows cabinetry but not the plan\u2019s pantry volume). E2: Adjacency relationships are incorrect because service core (WC/utility/HVAC) that should buffer hall and kitchen is not present, changing circulation and wall topology. Wall thickness is visually consistent in the render, but door embedding/partition continuity diverges from plan due to omitted walls."

Orthographic/isometric accuracy is acceptable but not strict-architectural (camera feels slightly perspective).

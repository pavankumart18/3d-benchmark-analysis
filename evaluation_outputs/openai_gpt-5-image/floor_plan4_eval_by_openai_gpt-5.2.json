However, several openings do not match: extra/mismatched windows appear on the bottom exterior wall (hall/bath zone) not indicated in the 2D plan (E5/E2). Door placement/orientation around the hall-to-bath/closet area appears simplified and not fully consistent with the plan\u2019s closet/bath doorway geometry (E2/E3). Some proportional drift is visible: the central hall/closet/bath partitioning is less tight/accurate than the 2D plan suggests (E4)."

Wall thickness looks consistent, but the hall/bath/closet micro-layout is not faithfully reproduced (closet segmentation/doorway treatment appears altered) (E2/E1). At least one hallucinated exterior window on the bottom wall reduces fidelity (E5). No clearly hallucinated rooms, but some partitions/closet definition looks incomplete compared to the 2D plan (E1/E2)."

Kitchen casework/appliances are simplified versus the 2D plan (L-shaped counter/sink placement not fully represented) and some bedroom furnishings from the plan appear omitted or replaced with generic blocks (E1/E2). Scale is generally consistent but schematic."

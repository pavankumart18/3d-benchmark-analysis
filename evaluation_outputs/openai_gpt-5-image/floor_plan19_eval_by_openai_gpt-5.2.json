The living/dining is generally central, but multiple walls/room boundaries around the right-side bedroom cluster (Bed-1/Bed-4/C.Toi/Toi-1/utility) are rearranged. The two distinct decks in the plan (long main deck + smaller deck at Bed-1) are not clearly reproduced as two separate, correctly shaped exterior spaces. Several interior openings/doors do not match the plan\u2019s positions and swing/orientation, and window placement is substantially simplified compared to the plan. Room proportions (notably living/dining and kitchen/utility widths) appear distorted."

Some rooms/bathrooms appear merged or re-partitioned compared to the 2D plan. Doors are often represented as open portals without correct embedding/swing representation, reducing fidelity. No clear evidence of an exact foyer/HQ segmentation as shown in plan."

Scale is inconsistent (dining table/chair spacing appears oversized relative to circulation)."

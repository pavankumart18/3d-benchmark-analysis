Stair geometry/enclosure differs from the U-shaped stair block in plan. Bathroom footprint/door sides do not match the plan\u2019s centered bathroom layout. Overall room proportions and opening placement are not preserved."

        "notes": "Exterior wall loop is present but internal partitions do not faithfully reproduce the plan: the stair core boundaries and adjacent partitioning are different, and the bathroom is simplified and not embedded as shown. Adjacency is partially correct (kitchen-left, large open living/dining-right), but key plan-defined openings are missing and multiple unplanned openings are added. Wall thickness appears mostly consistent, but door embedding/orientation does not follow plan."

Geometry is mostly clean with no major mesh artifacts, but the scene is sparse (limited interior detail), reducing clarity for verification."

Adjacencies are mostly preserved (bedrooms grouped on right, kitchen on lower-left, central living/dining), yet smaller service spaces shown in 2D (closet/utility-like subareas and at least one compact wet-area partitioning) are simplified/merged, effectively missing distinct rooms/segments from the 2D plan (E1).

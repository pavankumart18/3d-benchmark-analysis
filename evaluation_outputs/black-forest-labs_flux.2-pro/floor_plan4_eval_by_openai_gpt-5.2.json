        "notes": "Overall layout is recognizable (kitchen/dining left, living central/top, bedrooms right, bath central-right, laundry bottom-left), but several plan-to-model mismatches reduce accuracy. The living room appears undersized relative to kitchen/dining compared to the stated areas in the 2D plan (E4). Hallway/circulation geometry is simplified and widened in places, altering wall alignment around the bathroom/closet zone (E4/E2). Multiple door locations and swing orientations do not cleanly match the 2D plan (notably the laundry/closet cluster and the bath/closet doors) (E2/E3). Window placement is inconsistent: Bedroom 2\u2019s exterior windows appear redistributed (right wall count/positions differ; bottom-wall window from plan not represented) (E2)."

        "notes": "Primary adjacencies mostly hold (bath off hall; bedrooms off hall; kitchen open to living), but small service spaces are not faithfully preserved. The closet/laundry/entry cluster is structurally simplified, and at least one closet is not clearly represented as a discrete enclosed room per the plan (E1). Door embedding is inconsistent (several doors read as oversized and/or not seated correctly in wall thickness) (E6). Window openings also do not match the plan\u2019s distribution (E2). No clear hallucinated extra room volume, but internal partitions are altered enough to count as structural deviation."

Some items are scaled/positioned in ways that don\u2019t reflect the tighter plan proportions (e.g., living seating zone and bedroom clearances) (E4). Bedroom 2\u2019s desk/bed arrangement does not clearly match the plan\u2019s intended layout (E2)."

However, several door elements appear visually incorrect (odd swings/intersections/oversized leafs), indicating modeling artifacts (E6). Lighting is acceptable but somewhat flat; edges/openings lack crispness. Projection is perspective-isometric rather than strict orthographic isometric."

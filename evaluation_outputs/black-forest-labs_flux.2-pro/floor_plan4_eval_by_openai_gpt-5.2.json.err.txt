    "notes": "Overall layout resembles the 2D plan (open kitchen/dining at left, living centered, bedrooms on right, bath near center-bottom), but several spatial mismatches exist. Closet/laundry subdivision at bottom-left is not clearly preserved (E1/E2), and the hall/core partitioning reads differently (E2). Multiple door locations/swing orientations appear inconsistent with the plan, especially around the hall–bath/closet cluster and the bedroom access (E2/E3). Window count/spacing on the long exterior walls does not match the plan’s smaller segmented openings, and at least one exterior opening appears where the plan shows none (E2/E5). Room proportions are somewhat distorted: hall/core seems enlarged and bedroom/living proportions appear shifted (E4)."

    "notes": "Key adjacency is mostly correct (kitchen/dining adjacent to living; bedrooms adjacent on right; bath off hall), but fidelity drops in the service core: the plan’s distinct Laundry + separate Closet at bottom-left is not faithfully represented as two clearly separated rooms (E1/E2). The closet near the bathroom/hall is unclear/merged compared to the plan (E1/E2). Several doors appear not embedded/positioned exactly on the walls shown in 2D, and some swings/opening directions differ (E2/E3). At least one window/opening seems hallucinated or overly enlarged relative to the plan (E5)."

    "notes": "Major furniture groups are present in the correct zones (dining table in kitchen/dining, sofa/coffee table in living, beds in bedrooms). However, placement and scale do not closely match the 2D symbols: living seating arrangement and casework lengths differ, and bedroom secondary furniture (desk/dresser) does not correspond to the plan’s implied layout (E2/E4)."

    "notes": "Render is clean and readable with good lighting and generally consistent geometry. Camera is a typical isometric/axonometric-style view but includes noticeable perspective (orthographic accuracy is limited). Some openings/frames look simplified or inconsistent, contributing to clarity issues in the hall/core area (E6)."

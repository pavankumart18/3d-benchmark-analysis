The bottom-right room labeled \"Monica's Bedroom\" in the 2D plan is rendered as an office/dining-like room with a large table and no clear bed (E1/E2). A bed appears in the bottom-center area instead, shifting bedroom location relative to the plan (E2). Bottom fa\u00e7ade window/door layout is inconsistent: the 3D shows extended/continuous glazing along the bottom-left and a large opening at the bottom-right that are not indicated in the plan (E2/E5). Several interior door locations/hinges do not align with the plan\u2019s swing/placement, especially around the central hall/den zone (E2/E3). Room proportions are noticeably altered (living/central hall widened; bedroom footprints not preserved) (E4)."

Wall thickness is mostly consistent, but several partitions/returns differ from the plan in the entry/den corridor and bedroom separations (E2/E4). Door embedding and orientation appear inconsistent with the plan in multiple locations (E2/E3). Multiple exterior openings appear hallucinated or relocated relative to the plan (E5/E2)."

However, multiple circulation/partition details diverge: central corridor partitions are rendered as curved/arched walls instead of the plan\u2019s straight walls and standard door openings (E2/E5). Several door locations/orientations are inconsistent with the plan\u2019s hinged doors (notably the openings around Kitchen/Living/Wash core), and at least one exterior door appears at the bottom-center protrusion that is not indicated as an entry in the 2D plan (E5). Window placement mostly follows exterior walls, but there are discrepancies in count/position (notably at/around the stair volume and some facade segments) (E2). Room proportions are slightly distorted: the corridor/core and kitchen enclosure read thicker/wider in 3D than in plan, affecting perceived usable area (E4)."

Door embedding is not faithfully modeled for several internal connections (door leaves/swing behavior replaced by open arches) (E2/E3). Adjacency relationships are mostly preserved (no major room swaps), and all primary rooms appear present (Dining, Kitchen, Living, Bedroom, Toilet, Wash Area, Stairs) (no E1). Hallucinated architectural elements are present: curved corridor walls/arches and an additional exterior opening/door not supported by the plan (E5)."

Minor mismatches in scale and spacing relative to the plan\u2019s implied clearances (e.g., seating group and core corridor clearances feel tighter/wider than 2D suggests) (E4). Some fixture placement in the wet core is approximate rather than plan-exact (E2)."

Lighting is clean and readable; geometry is mostly clean with good material separation. Visual clarity/composition is strong, though the curved partitions introduce a noticeable non-plan distortion (structural artifact from verification perspective)."

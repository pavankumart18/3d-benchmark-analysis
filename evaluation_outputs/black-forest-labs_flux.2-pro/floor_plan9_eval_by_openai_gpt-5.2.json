The central hall concept and right-side bedroom wing are suggested, but multiple room boundaries and transitions are simplified/shifted. Several doors are represented as open portals/arches rather than the plan\u2019s hinged doors, and their locations/orientations do not consistently match the 2D swings. Window distribution on exterior walls is inconsistent with the plan (missing and/or repositioned openings). Room proportions appear distorted: the large open living/kitchen zone and the right-side suite/bedroom areas do not preserve the plan\u2019s relative widths/lengths."

Adjacency is partially correct (bedrooms to hall), but the master suite/bath/closet geometry and connections are not reliably preserved. Wall thickness looks mostly consistent in the render, but door embedding is frequently incorrect (open archways where doors should exist) and some openings appear inserted without corresponding 2D locations."

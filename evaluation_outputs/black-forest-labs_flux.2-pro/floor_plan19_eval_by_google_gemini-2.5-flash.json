Door embedding is generally correct but some doors appear to be flush with walls rather than properly recessed. Adjacency relationships are mostly maintained, but the outdoor patio/deck areas deviate significantly. No entirely missing rooms, but the 'HO' room and a small patio section are heavily altered. No hallucinated rooms, but hallucinated structural elements exist on the deck spaces."

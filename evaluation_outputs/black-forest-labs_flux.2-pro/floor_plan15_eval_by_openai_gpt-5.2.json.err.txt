    "notes": "Major layout drift from the 2D plan. The 3D model introduces a curvilinear central hall/corridor system, whereas the 2D plan is predominantly rectilinear with straight passages (E2/E4). Living/Dining placement is not convincingly centered with the correct balcony relationship (top-center balcony in plan vs different terrace/balcony configuration in 3D) (E2). Kitchen/utility zone does not clearly match the plan’s compact kitchen with an attached utility at the far right (E1/E2). Door locations and swing/orientation for toilets/bedrooms do not match the plan’s door positions along the straight passage walls (E2/E3). Exterior window/slider placement and sizing appear redistributed (large glazing runs and openings not matching the plan’s window positions per room) (E2). Several room proportions/widths are distorted by the curved circulation and widened/reshaped rooms (E4)."

    "notes": "Wall thickness appears generally consistent and clean, but the structural partitioning is not faithful to the plan (curved/angled walls replace straight partitions) (E2/E4). Adjacencies are compromised: the plan’s clear right-side sequence (Bedroom-2 + attached toilet near the right; kitchen + utility below/right) is not preserved cleanly in the 3D arrangement (E2). The plan indicates multiple toilets including a powder/toilet near the entrance/passage; the 3D render does not clearly show the same count and locations, implying missing/relocated toilet(s) and/or utility (E1/E2). Hallucinated architectural features (not in plan) such as interior steps/entry stair element and exaggerated terrace/deck treatments reduce fidelity (E5)."

    "notes": "Bedrooms are furnished with beds and side tables and the living area has sofa seating, generally plausible. However, dining/kitchen furniture placement does not clearly align with the 2D plan’s living+dining zone centered near the living balcony and the compact kitchen at the right (E2). Some furniture appears scaled/fit to the altered curved circulation rather than to the original room proportions (E4)."

    "notes": "Visually clean isometric presentation with coherent lighting and good material/geometry readability. Camera is broadly isometric-like. However, it is not an orthographically faithful translation of the 2D plan (curved partitions, remodeled balcony/terrace edges, redistributed openings), which reduces projection/plan-to-3D accuracy despite good render quality."

Major zoning errors: the plan\u2019s clear separation of Theatre (left-middle), Bed 2 (left-middle), Activity (upper-middle), and the Living/Kitchen core is not preserved. The 3D appears to convert multiple distinct rooms into larger open areas and relocates wet areas. Door locations and swing/orientation do not follow the plan, and exterior openings (alfresco/verandah/portico connections) are not represented correctly. Room proportions are noticeably altered (e.g., Living/Kitchen/Theatre regions)."

Multiple labeled plan spaces are missing or merged. The model introduces elements not present in the plan (a central stepped/railed feature resembling a stair/sunken area). Wall thickness looks generally consistent, but interior partitions do not match the plan\u2019s wall alignment and segmentation."

Several spaces that should contain specific built-ins (robes/WIR/pantry/laundry bench) are not represented accurately. Scale is plausible visually, but the furniture placement corresponds to a different layout."

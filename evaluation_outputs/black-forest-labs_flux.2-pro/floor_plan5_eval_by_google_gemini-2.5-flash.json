Furniture scale consistency is poor; some items appear too large or too small relative to the rooms. Many small details like sinks and cooktops are missing or simplified."

Geometry is generally clean with few obvious artifacts, but the overall visual clarity is reduced by missing details and inconsistent proportions. The composition is standard for an isometric view."

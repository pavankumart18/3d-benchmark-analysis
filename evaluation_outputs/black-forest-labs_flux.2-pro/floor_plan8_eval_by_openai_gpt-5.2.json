In the 3D render, the bottom-center Dining room bump-out/shape is not preserved and the main space reads as one large open area. (E2) Pantry location/shape is incorrect: 2D shows a pantry room near the center-left of kitchen; 3D replaces the central core with a small bathroom-like room. (E3/E2) Exterior door placement differs: 2D shows an exterior door at the bottom-right wall; 3D shows a prominent exterior opening/door at bottom-center. (E2) Window positions/counts on the right and bottom walls do not match the 2D plan\u2019s specific window groupings."

(E1/E2) The Dining room as a distinct enclosed/defined zone is effectively missing/merged. (E2) Foyer/closet arrangement at the upper-left is not faithfully reconstructed (closet geometry and openings differ). (E2/E3) Door embeddings and swings are not consistently aligned with the 2D plan (notably the main exterior access and several interior openings). Wall thickness appears mostly consistent, but many walls/partitions do not align to the 2D wall network."

(2) Several door openings are simplified/relocated (notably around kitchen/foyer, dining-to-bedroom passage, and bathroom entries), with missing swing/orientation fidelity (E2/E3). (3) Window placement is incomplete/ambiguous on exterior walls versus the plan\u2019s indicated openings (E1/E2). (4) Corridor and bathroom proportions appear compressed/reshaped relative to the plan, affecting the central service core and right-side bedroom cluster (E4)."

(2) Door embedding between tight wet areas and the passage is inconsistent with the plan (several openings appear widened/shifted) (E2). (3) Central toilet cluster/powder room segmentation near dining/bedroom-4 zone appears consolidated or rearranged versus the 2D partitions (E2/E4). No clearly added full extra rooms, but added non-plan partitions/forms are present."

Bedroom beds are present but some orientations/placements do not tightly follow the 2D layout (E2/E3). Kitchen cabinetry/appliance placement is stylized and does not strictly match the plan\u2019s counters and fixture positions (E2). Some furniture scale (chairs/sofas) appears oversized relative to circulation widths (E4)."

Minor issues: slight perspective/orthographic inconsistency (more perspective than strict axonometric) and some softened/rounded geometry that obscures exact plan compliance (E6). Composition and material clarity are good."

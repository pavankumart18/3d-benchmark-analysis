        "notes": "Overall layout (2 bedrooms, living/dining central, kitchen+utility lower left, two toilets, two decks) is broadly consistent, but several plan-level placements diverge. The foyer/entry zone appears enlarged/reshaped in the 3D compared to the compact foyer+short passage in the 2D (E4). The attached toilet (TOI-1) reads as more corridor-accessed than strictly bedroom-attached as in the plan (door relationship unclear/shifted) (E2/E3). Door swings/positions for the common toilet and internal passage do not match the plan\u2019s hinge locations and opening directions (E2/E3). Window/opening placement on the long outer left wall and deck-facing openings look simplified/standardized vs the plan\u2019s specific window segments (E2). Room proportion balance is slightly off: living/dining reads compressed relative to bedrooms compared with the stated dimensions (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall runs and major adjacencies are mostly correct (Bed-2 adjacent to living; Bed-1 on right; kitchen connected to living; utility off kitchen; two decks on top side). However, wall thickness is stylized and not consistently matching the plan\u2019s heavy structural walls vs partitions (E6/E4). Door embedding is inconsistent in a few places (some doors appear floating or not aligned to the exact wall breaks shown in plan) (E6/E2). The TOI-1 adjacency/attachment to Bed-1 is weakened by apparent corridor-style access (E2). No major room is entirely omitted, but the foyer/passage segmentation is not faithfully preserved (E4)."

Scale feels inconsistent: dining set and some seating appear undersized relative to circulation and room extents; bedroom furniture spacing also looks more generous than the plan implies (E4)."

Projection is mostly correct for an isometric-style render, though some perspective/foreshortening makes proportional comparison harder (minor) (E6). Lighting is clean and even. Geometry is generally clean, but door arcs/door leaves and some openings feel slightly mis-registered to walls (E6). Overall composition is strong."

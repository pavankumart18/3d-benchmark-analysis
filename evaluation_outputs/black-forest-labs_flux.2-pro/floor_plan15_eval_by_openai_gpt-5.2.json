        "notes": "Major plan-to-render mismatch. The 2D plan is predominantly orthogonal with straight passages; the 3D model introduces large curved corridor walls and curved door openings (E2/E4), altering the core circulation geometry. The living & dining zone location is roughly central, but its boundaries and connectivity do not match the plan\u2019s straight-walled layout (E2). Balcony configuration deviates: the plan shows 2 balconies (master-left and living/top-center), while the 3D shows additional/expanded terrace-like exterior platforms and different balcony extents/positions (E5/E2). Door placement/orientation is inconsistent with the plan: multiple oversized curved openings appear where standard hinged doors are expected; several door positions along the main passage do not align to the plan (E2/E3). Window placement is also inconsistent: the 3D adds large glazed openings on the right facade and different opening patterns not indicated in the plan (E5/E2). Room proportions are not preserved due to the curved corridor consuming/reshaping room depths compared with the plan\u2019s dimensioned rectangles (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness and structural language are not consistent with the 2D plan: many walls appear uniformly thick and softened/rounded in 3D, unlike the plan\u2019s clear rectilinear partitions (E4). Door embedding is often incorrect: openings are modeled as wide, arched/curved portals rather than standard door leaves located at the plan\u2019s door swings (E2/E3). Adjacency relationships are partially broken by the re-shaped corridor; several rooms appear to open into the curved hall in ways not matching the plan\u2019s straight passage connections (E2). Toilet count/locations are unclear and appear reduced/merged compared to the plan\u2019s multiple toilets including a powder toilet near entrance (likely missing or relocated) (E1/E2). Additional exterior deck/terrace elements and facade openings not present in the plan are introduced (E5)."

However, the 3D introduces extensive furniture layouts (multiple sofas, side tables, large kitchen island/counters, etc.) that cannot be confirmed from the plan (E5). Some furniture appears oversized relative to the altered corridor width and room proportions (E4)."

        "notes": "Visually clean and coherent as a standalone isometric render with decent material consistency and readable room separation. However, the camera is perspective-heavy rather than a true orthographic/isometric technical view (E6). Lighting is acceptable but somewhat flat; geometry is clean, though the curved-wall design choice creates a strong deviation from the rectilinear plan (counted under fidelity rather than aesthetics). Overall composition is clear but not a faithful architectural translation."

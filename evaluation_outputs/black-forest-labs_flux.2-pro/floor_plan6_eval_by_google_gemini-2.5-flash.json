Adjacency relationships are largely preserved, but the changes in the bathroom and the area near the stairs affect this. Several rooms are missing or heavily modified (e.g., the smaller storage space/utility room by the stairs is not clearly rendered, and the entrance area is significantly altered). No clearly hallucinated rooms, but existing rooms are heavily distorted."

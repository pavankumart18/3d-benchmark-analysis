The 'Recess' area from the floorplan appears to be missing from the right side of the Living room. The 'Portico' and 'Verandah' are visually absent, replaced by a simple outdoor seating area. The Laundry room is significantly altered in layout and missing the WM (Washing Machine). The BED 3 and BED 4 area appears to be a single large room, and the 'Desk Recess' is also missing. The 'Alfresco' area is also significantly distorted in terms of shape."

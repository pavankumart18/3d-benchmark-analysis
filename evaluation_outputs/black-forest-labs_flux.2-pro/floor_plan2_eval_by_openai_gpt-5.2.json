Door integration is inconsistent (some doors appear shifted relative to wall corners/segments)."

Some items are repositioned (master bed/desk and living set) in ways that do not match the 2D arrangement, and some scales feel inconsistent (oversized circulation relative to room furnishing)."

However, it is not a true orthographic/isometric match to the 2D (perspective depth is present), and some geometry reads simplified (partition lengths and openings not crisply aligned to the plan). Overall composition is clear."

Adjacency relationships are incorrect for the garage, balcony, and several internal rooms. The balcony is a missing room. The garage is detached, which is a significant structural deviation. The WC appears to have a hallucinated wall. The 'Linen' closet is represented as a door opening into an undesignated space."

        "notes": "Overall layout roughly matches (Living/Dining left, Kitchen top-left, Bedroom bottom-right, Toilet center-right, Utility top-right, Balcony bottom-left). However, the 3D introduces an additional enclosed space at far right that is not present in the 2D plan, altering wall layout and spatial reading. Door placements/orientations are not fully faithful: the bathroom/bedroom doors appear shifted and their swing/orientation does not clearly match the plan. Window/opening placement is inconsistent: the long slit windows and their positions do not clearly correspond to the 2D window locations; balcony opening/door detailing is unclear. Room proportions appear somewhat distorted (toilet/utility/right-side zone depth and bedroom wall lengths do not preserve the plan\u2019s proportions)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent and doors are embedded plausibly, but adjacency relationships are compromised by a hallucinated extra room/partition on the right side (not in plan), which changes the toilet/utility boundary condition. Core rooms are present (no obvious missing named rooms), yet the added space counts as a structural hallucination and reduces fidelity. Some internal partitions (near toilet/utility) do not match the 2D plan\u2019s clean rectangular enclosure."

Minor mismatches in exact positioning and clearances (e.g., seating and table offsets; bedroom desk/chair placement not clearly indicated in 2D) but overall scale is reasonably consistent."

Lighting is acceptable and geometry is mostly clean with good material separation. Minor clarity issues: openings/windows are stylized and do not precisely communicate plan-accurate fenestration; some edges/partitions look simplified versus the plan."

        "notes": "Overall layout (4 bedrooms around a central living/dining with kitchen + utility below) is broadly consistent, but several plan-specific placements drift in the 3D. The bottom service band (H.O + small toilet + adjacent walls) does not read as the same arrangement as the 2D plan (E1/E2/E4). Some internal wall alignments around the kitchen/utility and the small central toilets appear shifted, changing corridor widths and room shapes (E2/E4). Door locations for multiple rooms appear re-centered/simplified versus the plan\u2019s corner/offset placements (E2/E3). Window/opening extents along the outer fa\u00e7ade are exaggerated into large continuous openings/railings compared to the more segmented window runs in plan (E2/E4)."

Adjacencies are mostly preserved (bedrooms connect to living/dining/corridors; toilets near respective zones), yet the exact service-core partitioning at the bottom (H.O/toilet cluster) is not faithfully reproduced (E1/E2). No clearly new major rooms are added, but the fa\u00e7ade opening treatment and some built-in elements behave like hallucinated architectural modifications rather than plan-driven details (E5)."

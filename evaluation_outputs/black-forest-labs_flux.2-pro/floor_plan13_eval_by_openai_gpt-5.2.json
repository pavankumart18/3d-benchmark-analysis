(1) Room placement: overall zoning is roughly similar (living/dining left, bedrooms right, wet areas central), but the entry sequence and internal circulation are substantially altered (E2/E5). (2) Wall alignment: multiple interior walls do not follow the 2D plan; several walls are curved/rounded where the plan is rectilinear (E2/E5). (3) Doors: the main entry door is not clearly present; several internal door positions and swings do not match the plan\u2019s hallway-to-rooms placements (E2/E3). (4) Windows: balcony opening/door is not represented; window counts/locations on exterior walls differ from the plan (E1/E2). (5) Proportions: lounge/dining and corridor proportions appear distorted relative to the labeled dimensions; bedroom and wet-area sizing/spacing is inconsistent with the plan (E4)."

        "notes": "Structural correspondence is weak. Wall thickness looks mostly consistent visually, but the plan\u2019s adjacency relationships are altered by the curved hall partitions and shifted openings (E2/E5). The plan indicates a separate Bath and separate WC; the 3D appears to change wet-area partitioning/fixture placement and/or merges functions inconsistently (E2/E1). Missing elements include the balcony and the entry/linen definition (E1). No clear additional full rooms are added, but several non-plan partitions/features are introduced (hallucinated geometry) (E5)."

Geometry quality is generally clean, but the introduced curved partitions create a mismatch with the rectilinear source (conceptual artifact vs. plan) (E5). Composition is clear; garage render is neat."

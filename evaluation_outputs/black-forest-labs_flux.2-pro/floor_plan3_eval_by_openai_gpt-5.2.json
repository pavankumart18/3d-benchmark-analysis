The 2D plan is essentially one large open space (kitchen top-left, dining top-right, living right) with a stair zone bottom-left and a small central bathroom, plus a single entrance at bottom-center. The 3D render instead shows multiple enclosed rooms (including what reads as a bedroom) and a central corridor/stair core, breaking the intended open-plan layout. Wall locations and room placements do not align with the 2D boundaries. Door and window positions do not correspond to the plan\u2019s openings. Overall proportions and zoning (left/right split and central bathroom placement) are not preserved."

The bathroom is not embedded/positioned as the small centered block with the same access points. Multiple additional partitions create rooms not in the plan, and several planned openings (entrance and wall windows) are not faithfully reproduced. Wall thickness looks visually consistent in 3D but fidelity to the plan\u2019s structure is very low."

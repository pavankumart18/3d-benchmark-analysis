        "notes": "Overall room layout roughly matches (Activity left, Balcony bottom-left, Bed2 bottom-center, Bed3 bottom-right, Bed4 top-right, Bath/WC central), but several major spatial deviations exist: Balcony is rendered as an enclosed/glazed room rather than an open balcony with balustrade (E2/E5). Multiple room dimensions/proportions do not match the 2D plan (Activity, Bed2, Bed3 labels/sizes differ) (E4). An apparent exterior opening/door at the bottom-center facade appears in 3D that is not shown on the plan (E5/E2). Door swing/orientation in the Bath/WC corridor appears inconsistent with the plan\u2019s door placements/swing directions (E3)."

        "notes": "Most walls and key adjacencies are preserved (beds adjacent to corridor; Bath and WC adjacent at top center; robes in similar locations). However, the balcony enclosure via continuous glazing changes the structural intent from exterior space with balustrade to interior-like space (E2/E5). A hallucinated exterior entry/opening on the bottom-center wall breaks fidelity (E5). Door integration looks plausible but at least one door orientation/swing differs from plan (E3). No rooms are fully omitted, but the balcony treatment is structurally incorrect."

        "notes": "Bedroom furniture (beds/side tables) and robe locations are broadly consistent. Activity room furniture is not clearly specified in the 2D plan (iconography differs), so the 3D bed-like placement is only partially supported (E2). Furniture scale appears generally consistent with room sizes, though room proportion errors reduce confidence."

Balcony glazing/continuous window wall looks visually polished but is a fidelity error relative to the plan. No major rendering artifacts observed."

Major dimensional/proportion drift: foyer labeled 4'9\"x3'0\" in 3D vs 4'6\"x3'10\" in plan (E4); toilet labeled ~4'8\"x6'0\" in 3D vs 4'9\"x8'0\" in plan, significantly shortening the room (E4). Door placement/orientation is inconsistent: main entry/foyer boundary treatment and interior door swings do not consistently match the 2D swing directions and locations (E2/E3). Window placements are not faithfully mapped: 3D shows large exterior glazing on faces that do not match the plan\u2019s smaller window positions and counts (E2/E4)."

Wall thickness is inconsistent between exterior and interior partitions compared to the plan (E4). The OTS/shaft indicated near the toilet in the 2D plan is not clearly present in the 3D model (E1). Several openings/doors appear embedded differently than the plan (alignment to wall segments and swing depiction) (E2/E3). No extra rooms are added, but multiple window elements appear exaggerated beyond plan intent (borderline hallucinated glazing magnitude) (E5/E4)."

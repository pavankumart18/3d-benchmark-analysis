Several openings (doors/windows) do not align with the 2D positions, and some room proportions (notably entry/lobby depth and right-side suite massing) appear distorted compared to the plan."

However, two exterior spaces (balconies) are missing entirely, which is a significant structural fidelity failure. Some openings appear embedded/placed differently than the plan, and a few windows are introduced where the 2D plan suggests balcony openings or different fenestration."

Exact placement/orientation is not tightly matched to the 2D plan, and some scale relationships (walkways around dining/sofas) appear looser than the plan implies."

The 2D shows Central Hall, WC, Utility Room (with W/D and HVAC), Kitchen + Pantry, Dining Room, Breakfast/Window Seat/Alcove areas, and stair/UP zone. The 3D render instead depicts a different layout resembling a small apartment with a bedroom, living/dining open area, and a different bathroom/kitchen arrangement. Wall locations, room placement, and adjacencies do not correspond (E2/E5). Door locations and swings in 3D do not match the plan\u2019s door positions (e.g., Utility/Kitchen/Dining connections) (E2/E3). Window placements/counts do not match the plan (plan indicates specific windows incl. window seat area; 3D uses generic evenly spaced windows) (E2). Room proportions are not preserved (Dining room in plan is large central-right; 3D has no equivalent sized space) (E4)."

The 3D introduces rooms not present in the shown plan segment (e.g., bedroom) (E5). Adjacency relationships are incorrect (plan: Kitchen adjacent to Pantry + Utility + Dining; 3D adjacency differs) (E2). Door embedding/orientation cannot be validated as correct because most corresponding walls/doors are not present (E2/E3). Wall thickness looks consistent internally in the render but is not faithful to the plan\u2019s wall layout (E2)."

The plan segment primarily specifies functional spaces (kitchen fixtures, W/D, HVAC, etc.), while the 3D includes a bedroom set and living/dining furniture not indicated (E5). Kitchen fixture layout (range/sink/refrigerator/pantry relationship) does not match the plan (E2). Furniture scale appears plausible within the 3D scene but is not verifiably consistent with the plan\u2019s dimensions due to the layout mismatch (E4)."

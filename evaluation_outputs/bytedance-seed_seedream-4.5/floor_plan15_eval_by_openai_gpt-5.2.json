(E2) Kitchen is shown as an open integrated space into the living/dining in 3D, while the 2D plan has a clearly separated kitchen with a door and a dedicated utility. (E1) Utility room is not clearly present as a separate space. (E2/E3) Entrance location/orientation appears wrong: 2D entrance is centered along the bottom edge entering living/dining; 3D shows a primary exterior door on the right facade leading into the kitchen/dining zone. (E2) Toilet placements do not match: the 2D has multiple toilets including a powder/toilet near entrance and toilets near bedrooms; 3D shows fewer/relocated toilets and different adjacency. (E4) Corridor/wide-passage geometry and room proportions are not preserved; 3D compresses/reshapes the long linear plan into a more compact block. (E2) Balcony arrangement differs: 2D has 2 balconies (living/dining top-center and master on left); 3D shows prominent stacked left-side balconies and a rear balcony layout that does not clearly match the plan\u2019s positions and access points. (E2) Window placement/count does not correspond to the 2D openings; several facade windows appear arbitrary relative to the plan."

(E1) Powder toilet (P.Toilet) near the entrance in the 2D plan is not represented as a distinct room in 3D. (E2) Bedroom/toilet adjacencies are inconsistent with the plan (toilets appear reduced and/or repositioned). (E5) Exterior massing/facade elements (multiple stacked balconies and extra window placements) introduce features not supported by the single-floor 2D plan. Wall thickness is visually consistent, but wall alignment and room boundary locations do not track the 2D plan."

Lighting is pleasing and geometry is mostly clean, but the cutaway/void and facade detailing emphasize a different building concept than the 2D plan, reducing architectural clarity as a verification render."

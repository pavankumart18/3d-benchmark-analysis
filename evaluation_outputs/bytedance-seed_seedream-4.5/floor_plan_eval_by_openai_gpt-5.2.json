Exterior wall stepping/jogs on the left side are simplified, altering room footprints. Several door locations/swing orientations are approximate rather than matching the plan precisely. Windows do not match the plan (extra windows added on the south/west exterior; Monica bedroom window on the east wall appears missing). Room proportions are distorted by the simplified outer shell and shifted kitchen."

        "notes": "Adjacency relationships are violated by relocating/duplicating the kitchen (kitchen should adjoin the bath/coat zone and left wall geometry as drawn). At least one required opening (Monica bedroom exterior window) is missing, while additional exterior windows are hallucinated. The left-side stepped boundary present in the 2D plan is not faithfully reproduced in 3D, changing wall alignments and implied wall lengths. Door embedding is inconsistent (some openings appear as arched/rounded cutouts not consistent with the plan\u2019s standard hinged doors)."

Bedroom furniture orientation/placement is not reliably consistent with the 2D plan (notably Rachel\u2019s bedroom arrangement). Scale is stylized and not clearly dimension-faithful."

However, several openings use stylized rounded cutouts and simplified massing that reduce technical clarity versus an orthographic-faithful architectural model. Overall composition is strong despite plan inaccuracies."

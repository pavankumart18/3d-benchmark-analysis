However, door locations/orientations are not faithfully represented (many doors are missing and represented as open voids), and exterior window placement on the right facade appears simplified vs. the 2D plan (window counts/locations do not clearly match). Some proportion drift is visible (alfresco/living and central circulation widths look adjusted compared to the plan)."

        "notes": "Wall networks and adjacencies are largely consistent with the 2D plan (laundry/bath/WC cluster adjacent to the secondary bedrooms; pantry attached to kitchen; living connected to alfresco; garage connected near entry). Wall thickness looks mostly consistent. Major fidelity loss comes from incorrect/absent door embedding (door leaves/swing positions not modeled, several openings treated as doorless passages), reducing verification of correct door placement."

However, furniture is highly schematic/blocky and several items appear loosely placed and not dimensionally faithful to the 2D implied clearances (scale consistency is only moderate)."

Geometry is generally clean with minimal distortions. Visual clarity is good, though heavy text overlays reduce architectural legibility for openings (doors/windows)."

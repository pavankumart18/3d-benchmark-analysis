Door embedding is incorrect for some doors. Adjacency relationships are mostly correct. One room (the small storage/utility space near the stairs) appears to be missing or significantly altered. No hallucinated rooms, but internal structural elements like the small wall separating the kitchen island from the main living space are missing."

The scale of some present furniture items appears inconsistent with the floor plan or with each other.

The couch is split into two, and its orientation is incorrect."

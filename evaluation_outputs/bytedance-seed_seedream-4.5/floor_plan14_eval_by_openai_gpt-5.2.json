Doorways to decks and exterior glazing do not match the plan, and TOI-1 proportions are significantly distorted (render shows ~3' width vs 5' in plan). Window/door placement on exterior walls is notably inconsistent with the 2D drawing."

        "notes": "Primary enclosure and internal partitions largely preserve adjacency (beds adjacent to living/dining; kitchen adjacent to utility; toilets positioned near their expected zones). However, the render introduces an additional exterior terrace/balcony mass and large curtain-wall style openings not indicated in plan (hallucinated elements). Wall thickness and door embedding look mostly consistent, but the TOI-1 size error is a structural/dimensional fidelity issue."

Minor mismatches in exact arrangement and scale relative to room boundaries are present (some furniture appears oversized/loose vs the tightness implied by the 2D plan)."

Some visual choices (large floor-to-ceiling glazing and added exterior deck) look polished but reduce plan-faithfulness; minor projection/camera exaggeration exists but remains generally coherent."

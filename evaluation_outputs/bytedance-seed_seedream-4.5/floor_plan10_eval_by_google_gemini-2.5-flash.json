Wall alignments are generally accurate, but some internal walls, especially around the BATH and WI areas, seem to have minor misalignments or thickness issues. Door placements are largely correct, but some doors, such as the one leading from the HALL to BED 3/4 area, are not clearly depicted or appear as openings. Window placements are represented but some appear oversized compared to the plan. Room proportions show minor distortions, making some rooms appear wider or longer than indicated by the dimensions."

The adjacency relationships are mostly correct. No missing rooms observed. No hallucinated rooms observed. However, several windows are hallucinated next to the PORTICO and at the back of the Study."

However, the exact configuration of some furniture items in the 3D render varies slightly from the 2D plan, for example, the seating arrangement in the Living area and the bed in the Master Suite. Furniture scale consistency is mostly maintained, but some items, like the study desk and chair, seem slightly disproportionate to the room size."

Lighting quality is generally good, showcasing the structure with soft shadows. Geometry is clean with no major distortions, although some wall intersections could be sharper. Visual clarity and composition are good, making it easy to identify rooms and features."

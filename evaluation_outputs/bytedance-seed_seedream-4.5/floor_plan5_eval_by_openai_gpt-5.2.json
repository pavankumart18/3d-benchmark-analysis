A bedroom appears placed in the bottom/center zone in 3D where the 2D plan indicates the main open living/dining circulation (E2). The top-right suite/rooming arrangement in 2D is not preserved in 3D (E2). Several door locations and swing/orientation do not match the 2D plan (notably internal doors around the central hall/living and right-side rooms) (E2/E3). Exterior window positions/count differ substantially from the 2D elevations implied by the plan (multiple missing/relocated windows, and oversized openings) (E2/E1/E4). Overall room proportions are distorted: the central living/dining appears oversized while right-side rooms/corridor are compressed/reorganized (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent in the render, but several partitions are shifted, changing adjacency relationships (e.g., right-side bedrooms/baths/utility cluster does not match 2D adjacency) (E2). Door embedding is inconsistent with plan: multiple openings are placed on different walls or with different swing directions than shown (E2/E3). At least one room function appears missing or replaced (e.g., a planned bedroom/right-side room is effectively replaced by an office-like space), and at least one extra/altered space appears introduced by re-partitioning (E1/E5). Balcony/porch projections do not reliably match the 2D footprint and their access points (E2/E4)."

A hallucinated/incorrect furnishing program appears in the top-left room (bed + dining/extra seating not indicated as such in the 2D plan) (E5). Scale is inconsistent: beds and living furniture appear oversized relative to some rooms and undersized relative to the enlarged central space (E4)."

Geometry is mostly clean, but openings/windows read as simplified/oversized compared to plan intent, reducing technical clarity (E6/E4). Overall composition and readability are strong."

    "notes": "Overall room zoning roughly matches (bedroom top-left, living/dining center-left, kitchen/utility right, balcony left, foyer bottom). However, several critical plan-to-render mismatches exist: the main entry/foyer connection appears relocated on the exterior facade (not clearly at the bottom-right as in plan) (E2/E3). Toilet is materially re-proportioned (plan 4'9\"x8'0\" vs render ~4'8\"x6'0\") causing corridor/bath geometry distortion (E4). Window placements on exterior walls do not match the plan’s limited/located openings; render uses large continuous glazing that is not indicated in plan (E2/E5)."

    "notes": "Primary adjacency is mostly preserved (toilet near bedroom/kitchen; utility adjacent to kitchen; balcony off living). Wall thickness looks fairly consistent, but door integration is inconsistent where the entry and internal openings do not align cleanly with the 2D layout (E2/E3). The toilet/foyer dimensional changes alter internal wall runs and reduce fidelity to the drawn boundary lengths (E4). The small duct/shaft next to the toilet shown in plan is not clearly modeled (E1). No extra rooms are introduced."

    "notes": "Key furniture is present (bed, sofa, dining, kitchen fixtures), but placement and scale are only loosely aligned with the plan symbols. Dining set/table appears oversized/shifted relative to the 2D placement, and kitchen fixture layout is simplified compared to plan (E2/E4)."

    "notes": "Isometric presentation is clear with good lighting and generally clean geometry. However, the render reads more like a stylized architectural visualization than a faithful orthographic/isometric translation of the 2D plan—especially due to exaggerated window/glazing treatment and softened dimensional accuracy (E6)."

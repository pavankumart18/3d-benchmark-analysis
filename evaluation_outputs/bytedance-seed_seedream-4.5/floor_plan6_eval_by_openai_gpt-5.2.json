        "notes": "Overall layout matches the 2D plan (kitchen/living left, main bedroom top-right, bath/closet core, stairs on right). However, multiple openings deviate: top-wall window configuration is not consistent with the plan, and several interior door positions/swings appear incorrect or missing. Some proportion drift is visible (bedroom and central circulation feel expanded relative to the living zone; window bay spacing on the long bottom wall does not precisely match the 2D rhythm)."

Fidelity drops due to interior door embedding/definition issues (some door leaves/frames are absent or represented as open portals) and incorrect/misaligned exterior window set on the top wall compared to the 2D plan."

Living furniture (sofa/coffee table) and dining table are present but not tightly aligned to the 2D positions and clearances. Bedroom furniture is plausible but not a strict match to the 2D drawing arrangement."

Minor issues: window/door modeling simplifications reduce architectural clarity (openings not consistently framed), and some elements look slightly stylized rather than strictly orthographic-faithful."

    "notes": "Overall room layout roughly matches (Living/Dining central, Bed-2 left, Bed-1 right, Kitchen/Utility bottom, two toilets), but there are notable deviations. The 3D adds a large exterior balcony/terrace at the bottom-left that is not present in the 2D plan (major spatial mismatch). TOI-1 size is incorrect (render shows ~3'x8' vs plan 5'x8'), and the Bed-1 deck dimensions are also altered. Several openings (especially large exterior glazing) appear oversized and/or not aligned with the 2D window/door intent. Door swing/orientation appears inconsistent in a few locations compared to the plan."

    "notes": "Adjacency relationships are mostly preserved (Kitchen adjacent to Utility; both toilets placed near the center; decks attached to bedrooms). Wall thickness looks generally consistent and doors are mostly embedded into walls. However, the model introduces a significant hallucinated exterior balcony/extension at the bottom-left, altering the building envelope. Dimensional fidelity is weak for TOI-1 and the right deck, indicating structural/proportional drift even where rooms exist."

    "notes": "Furniture types and general placement are broadly consistent (beds in bedrooms, sofa/coffee table in living, dining table centered, kitchen counters/appliances). Exact arrangement does not precisely match the 2D plan’s furniture layout, but scales appear mostly plausible."

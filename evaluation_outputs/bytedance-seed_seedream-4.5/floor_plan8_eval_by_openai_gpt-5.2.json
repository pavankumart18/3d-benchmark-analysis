(E2/E4) Kitchen + pantry arrangement does not match: pantry in 2D is a small enclosed room off the kitchen; in 3D it is an open central zone with an island/cabinets. (E2/E3) Door locations/orientations are inconsistent: the 2D shows a door swing between Dining and Kitchen area and a defined WC door; 3D does not reflect these placements. (E2) Window locations/types differ: 2D has multiple smaller windows distributed on exterior walls; 3D uses large floor-to-ceiling glazing and places openings that do not correspond to the plan. (E4) Room proportions are notably distorted (e.g., \"Powder Room\" area is far larger than any powder/WC zone in the 2D)."

(E5) Hallucinated large \"POWDER ROOM\" occupying a major portion of the plan that should be Living/Dining circulation. (E2) Stairs are represented differently: 2D shows an open stair/landing configuration central-top; 3D encloses/frames stairs with walls creating a different core and circulation. (E2) Adjacencies are wrong: in 2D, Living\u2013Dining\u2013Kitchen have a clear sequence; in 3D the central area is reorganized such that Dining is not between Living and Kitchen and pantry is not a discrete adjacent room."

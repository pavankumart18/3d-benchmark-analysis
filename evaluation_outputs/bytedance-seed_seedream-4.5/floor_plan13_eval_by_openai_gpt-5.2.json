        "notes": "Primary layout (lounge/dining left, kitchen central, bedrooms right, bath/WC center-bottom) is broadly similar, but there are major deviations: the balcony is not represented at the correct size/shape (appears as a much larger exterior void/terrace) (E2/E4), and the garage is modeled as attached to the unit rather than a separate standalone structure as shown on the plan (E2/E5). Dining room dimensions are also inconsistent (plan 3.3x3.1 vs render label 3.8x3.1) indicating proportion distortion (E4). Door positions are mostly consistent for internal rooms, but the balcony connection/opening placement is not faithful to the small balcony shown in plan (E2). Window placement cannot be reconciled cleanly with the plan\u2019s implied openings; multiple facade windows appear added/shifted (E2)."

        "notes": "Interior partitions are generally coherent and doors are embedded plausibly, but adjacency relationships are violated by the garage being integrated into the main envelope (plan shows garage separated) (E2/E5). The balcony element is effectively missing as a correctly bounded room/space and replaced by a larger exterior void (E1/E2/E4). Additional architectural elements not indicated in plan (e.g., small steps/platform near kitchen) reduce fidelity (E5). Wall thicknesses are visually consistent within the render but do not compensate for the plan-to-model structural mismatches."

Scales look generally plausible; however, the enlarged dining area labeling/dimensions undermine confidence in scale fidelity (E4)."

Geometry is mostly clean, though heavy wall outlines and the large open exterior void reduce architectural readability. Camera isometric is acceptable; projection is slightly stylized rather than strictly architectural/orthographic."

However, the right-side secondary room is represented/labeled as a bathroom instead of Bedroom 2, and the living room appears shrunk vs the 2D plan (area shown 228 vs 245). Several exterior window locations/sizes do not match the 2D plan (render uses large floor-to-ceiling/window groupings where the plan indicates smaller/standard windows). Entry/porch massing alters the perceived entry-door location."

Major fidelity failure: Bedroom 2 is not correctly realized; a second bathroom is introduced/indicated instead. This counts as both a missing-room and hallucinated-room issue under strict verification."

Secondary right-side room furniture does not clearly match the intended Bedroom 2 program due to the bathroom/bedroom mismatch, reducing mapping accuracy. Furniture scale is mostly consistent but simplified."

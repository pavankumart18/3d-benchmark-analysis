The main entrance at the top-right (double door/entry recess in plan) is not shown as an exterior entrance in the render (E1/E2). Multiple door locations/orientations do not match the swings/placements in plan, especially around the wash/toilet core and bedroom entry (E2/E3). Window placement does not match the plan\u2019s distribution (E2). Room proportions (notably kitchen depth/width and stair block proportions) appear distorted versus the plan (E4)."

        "notes": "Adjacency is partially preserved (kitchen near dining and living; wash/toilet near center; stair on right), but entry sequence is structurally wrong due to the missing/misplaced main entrance (E1/E2). Door embedding is inconsistent (several openings appear as generic gaps/arched portal rather than plan-accurate doors) (E2/E3/E5). Wall thickness is visually consistent, but some interior partitions differ from the plan\u2019s alignment around the bath core and bedroom connection (E2). One major planned element (the entrance) is missing as-built, and at least one element (arched interior opening) appears hallucinated (E5)."

However, bedroom vs living-room furnishing intent is inconsistent with the labeled/assigned spaces (E2).

Some furniture scale is acceptable, but spatial clearances (especially near doors/bath core) do not align with the plan (E4)."

However, the render uses stylistic elements (arched doorway) that reduce orthographic/plan-faithful accuracy (E5), and some openings read ambiguously (door vs void), slightly hurting clarity."

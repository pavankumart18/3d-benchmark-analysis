Balcony placement/extent appears shifted relative to the plan footprint (plan: bottom-left balcony; render: balcony reads as bottom/front and not clearly matching the left-offset position) (E2/E4). Additional interior partition/half-wall near the living seating area appears in the render but is not present in the plan (E5). Door set is incomplete due to missing utility access; other doors are roughly in expected zones but not strictly aligned to the plan locations (E2/E3). Window sizes/locations are not strictly preserved; exterior glazing in the render is larger/different than typical plan window markers (E2/E4)."

        "notes": "Wall thickness and door insertion look consistent in the render, but key structural fidelity issues remain: the Utility enclosure/walls are missing, breaking the intended adjacency (Kitchen\u2194Utility) and reducing the room count (E1). The balcony footprint/relationship to the living room does not reliably match the plan (E2/E4). A hallucinated interior partition changes circulation in the living area (E5). No clear hallucinated additional rooms beyond that, but the missing utility is a major structural failure."

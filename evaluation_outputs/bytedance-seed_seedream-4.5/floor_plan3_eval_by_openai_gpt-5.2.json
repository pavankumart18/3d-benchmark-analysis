The right-side open Living/Dining area is re-partitioned and labeled incorrectly (Living Room missing; 'LINING ROOM' shown) (E1/E2). Entrance location is inconsistent: 2D entrance is centered on the bottom wall; 3D shows an exterior door opening near the bottom-right wall segment (E2). Several interior doors are added/relocated (not matching plan\u2019s single bathroom door and limited interior openings) (E2/E5). Room proportions differ: bathroom and circulation areas are enlarged/reshaped relative to the compact central WC in plan (E4)."

Missing room labeling/function: Living Room not represented as such (E1). Hallucinated/incorrectly embedded doors: multiple red doors appear along the central spine that do not correspond to the 2D door count/locations (E5/E2). Window pattern around perimeter does not match the 2D window distribution (E2). Wall thickness appears visually consistent, but the added partitions significantly reduce fidelity."

        "notes": "Overall circulation roughly matches (living/dining central, kitchen below, utility to the right, bedrooms around perimeter), but there are major spatial mismatches: the top-right bedroom in the plan (BED-1 with attached TOI-1 and a small deck) is rendered as BED-2, while the left bedroom (plan BED-2) is rendered as BED-1 (E2). Both plan decks (large deck off living/dining and small deck off BED-1) are not represented (E1), causing incorrect exterior openings. Door locations are partially consistent internally, but exterior/terrace door logic deviates due to missing decks and an added balcony. Window placement is substantially different, especially the omission of the long top-side openings and the introduction of a large right-side glazed wall."

        "notes": "Wall thicknesses and most internal partitions read consistently, and key adjacencies (kitchen-utility, living-dining to bedroom corridor, bed4 near common toilet) are mostly preserved. However, two outdoor decks shown in the 2D plan are missing entirely (E1). A new large balcony/terrace with railing/steps at the bottom-right is introduced and is not present in the 2D plan (E5). Several door-to-exterior conditions are therefore structurally incorrect (missing deck access, added balcony access)."

Bedroom furniture is less faithful: BED-3 appears to contain two single beds in the render versus a different intended arrangement in the plan (E2), though overall scale is mostly consistent and not severely distorted."

Some visual clarity is reduced by the exaggerated/introduced right-side glazing and the added terrace/steps which visually redefines the building envelope compared to the plan."

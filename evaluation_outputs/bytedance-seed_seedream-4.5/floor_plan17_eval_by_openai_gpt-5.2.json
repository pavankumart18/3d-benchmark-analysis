(E2/E3) multiple door locations/swing orientations differ from the 2D plan, especially around the bedroom-zone corridor and the cluster of common/powder toilets near dining/bedroom 4. (E2) balcony sizing/labeling is inconsistent with the plan (2D indicates different balcony widths for living vs master; 3D shows both as the same). (E2/E1) window distribution does not match the 2D plan\u2019s implied openings\u2014several exterior walls that should have openings appear blank while large windows are emphasized on some facades without clear correspondence."

        "notes": "Primary room adjacencies are mostly preserved (kitchen next to utility, bedrooms grouped right, master with dress+toilets), but fidelity issues remain: (E4) wall runs and room outlines are simplified/shifted, impacting corridor definition and toilet block geometry. (E2/E3) door embedding and swing directions are not consistently aligned with the 2D plan, especially for small toilets. (E2) some exterior opening placements (windows/doors to balconies) do not consistently reflect the 2D layout. No clearly new/extra rooms are introduced, but the reconfiguration of service/toilet partitions reads as a partial plan rewrite rather than a faithful extrusion."

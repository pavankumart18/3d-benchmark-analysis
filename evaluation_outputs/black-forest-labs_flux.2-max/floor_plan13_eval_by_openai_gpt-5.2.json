Dining area is not clearly defined/separated as in plan (E2/E4). Balcony placement/relationship to lounge appears shifted (render shows a broad terrace-like platform not matching the small balcony off the lounge) (E2/E4). Bath/WC configuration and door positions do not match the plan\u2019s distinct Bath and separate WC arrangement (E2/E3). Multiple curved/rounded internal partitions change wall alignment compared to the rectilinear 2D plan (E2/E4). Window openings appear larger/longer and not aligned to the plan\u2019s indicated window spans (E2)."

Door embedding/orientation is inconsistent with the plan (several openings are shifted and/or represented with atypical curved returns) (E2/E3). Adjacencies are partially preserved (kitchen near living; bedrooms on right), but the service core (Bath/WC/L'dry/Linen) does not resolve to the same partitions as the plan (E2/E1). Linen closet at entry is not clearly present (E1). Balcony is represented as a larger terrace element, effectively altering the building envelope (E5/E4)."

Living/dining furnishings are largely missing or non-specific relative to the labeled dining/lounge areas (E1). Fixture scaling appears plausible, but the lack of mapped items prevents accurate verification."

Geometry is mostly clean, but the use of curved interior partitions and oversized glazing reads as a design reinterpretation rather than a faithful reconstruction (counts against orthographic/projection fidelity). Visual composition is strong, with good material differentiation."

        "notes": "Overall zoning roughly resembles the plan (3 bedrooms distributed left/center-right, living/dining central, kitchen at right, balconies at left and top), but the internal wall layout deviates substantially. The 2D plan\u2019s straight wide passages (left 1.10m, right 1.05m) are not preserved; the 3D introduces curved partitions and an open-flow core that changes room boundaries and circulation. Multiple doors shown in plan (powder/P-toilet, bedroom/toilet doors, kitchen door) do not match the 3D positions/orientations. Window placement is simplified/unclear compared to the plan\u2019s defined exterior openings. Room proportions (notably corridors, toilets, and kitchen/utility) appear distorted relative to the 2D dimensions."

        "score": 11,
        "max": 25,
        "notes": "Wall thickness looks visually consistent in the render, but plan-level structural fidelity is weak: several partitions are reshaped/relocated (curved/arched segments not in plan), changing adjacency and access logic. The plan indicates multiple toilets (including a small P-toilet near entrance and other toilets near bedrooms); the 3D does not clearly represent all of them as distinct enclosed rooms with correct doors. Kitchen/utility separation is not clearly maintained as a distinct enclosed utility room. Some correct adjacencies remain (balcony off living, bedroom wings), but several internal boundaries/door embeddings do not match the 2D."

        "notes": "Furniture is plausible but not mapped to the plan: the 2D shows conventional enclosed kitchen and defined dining/living arrangement, while the 3D uses a more open kitchen/island-like setup and generic bedroom layouts. Scale is generally consistent visually, but placement does not faithfully follow the 2D layout and room extents (especially around dining/kitchen and corridor areas)."

        "notes": "The isometric camera is coherent and the model is visually clean with good lighting/shadows and readable composition. However, it is not an orthographic-accurate translation of the plan (stylized curved geometry and open-plan treatment reduce projection fidelity). Geometry appears mostly clean with no major mesh artifacts."

However, placements and scales are not reliably aligned to the 2D plan (living seating arrangement and bedroom furniture positioning differ; some casework/fixture placements appear shifted), reducing mapping accuracy."

Main aesthetic penalty is the unnatural curved/warped door openings (reads as modeling artifact) and minor proportional oddities that reduce architectural believability."

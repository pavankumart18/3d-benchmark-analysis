(E1/E2) Balcony opening/door treatment is incorrect: the 2D plan implies a defined opening/slider on the living-to-balcony edge; the 3D shows a wide open gap without a clear door system. (E2) Window placement is not faithfully represented\u2014plan-indicated windows/openings on exterior walls are not consistently visible or are simplified/omitted. (E4) Some proportion drift: the balcony depth/opening and the bathroom/utility partitioning appear scaled differently than the 2D intent."

However: (E5) the added right-side tiled compartment functions like a hallucinated room, changing the plan's intended right-side non-occupiable space. (E1) The plan\u2019s implied shaft/closet/duct zone is not represented as such. (E2/E3) Door embedding and openings are simplified\u2014most notably the living-to-balcony connection lacks the correct door element and reads as an unframed opening."

Minor issues: slight perspective distortion relative to a strict isometric/orthographic requirement, and simplified openings/windows reduce visual clarity of architectural intent."

        "notes": "Room placements are significantly altered, leading to incorrect adjacencies. The kitchen, bathroom, and staircase are generally in their respective areas but with major layout changes. Wall alignment issues abound due to the reconfigured floor plan. Door placement is incorrect for the entrance and bathroom. Windows are completely different in number, size, and placement. Room proportions are entirely distorted due to the significant floor plan changes."

Adjacency relationships are severely violated (e.g., bathroom adjacent to stairs, kitchen open to bathroom). The dining room, living room are missing. There is a hallucinated open space next to the stairs, and the kitchen is significantly condensed."

Furniture scale consistency is difficult to assess accurately due to the overall proportion distortion of the rooms themselves, but individual items seem roughly scaled relative to each other."

Lighting quality is decent, providing clear visibility of the scene. Geometry generally looks clean. Visual clarity is good, and the composition is aesthetically pleasing despite the architectural inaccuracies."

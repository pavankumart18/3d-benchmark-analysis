        "notes": "Overall layout loosely matches (3 bedrooms, central living/dining, kitchen core, multiple toilets), but several plan-critical spatial relationships drift. Living & dining zone appears wider/more square in 3D than the narrow rectangular proportion in 2D (E4). Top exterior space reads as a long continuous terrace in 3D, while 2D specifies a distinct DECK plus a separate Bedroom-2 balcony (E2/E4). Right-side balcony for Bedroom-1 is present but its footprint/edge alignment appears simplified versus 2D (E4). Multiple door locations/orientations appear approximated (notably around the toilet cluster and corridor near kitchen/utility) (E2/E3). Window placements/openings are not clearly mapped to the 2D locations (E2)."

        "notes": "Adjacency is partially correct (kitchen near living, Bedroom-1 on right, Bedroom-3 on left), but corridor/lobby geometry is altered with extra angled/stepped wall segments not shown in 2D (E5/E2). Wall thickness is fairly consistent, but door embedding/orientation is inconsistent with the 2D swing logic and some openings appear shifted along walls (E2/E3). Bedroom-2 balcony is not convincingly separated from the main deck as in the plan (counts as misplaced/missing distinct element) (E1/E2). No clear extra full rooms beyond plan, but there are several hallucinated partitions/shape changes that modify circulation (E5)."

Kitchen includes a peninsula/island-like massing not indicated in the 2D plan (E5). Furniture scale is generally plausible but influenced by the altered room proportions (E4)."

Orthographic fidelity to the 2D plan is weakened by proportion/circulation changes."

        "notes": "Overall footprint is similar (central living/dining with kitchen on lower-left and bedrooms on left/top-right/bottom-right), but multiple layout deviations are present. Several interior wall runs and offsets do not align with the 2D plan (notably the left-side suite and the top-middle wet-area corridor). Door locations/swing directions are frequently inconsistent with the plan, especially around the central hall and bedroom entries. Window positions/counts along the top and right exterior walls do not match the 2D drawing. Some room proportions (bedroom sizes and corridor widths) appear altered vs. the plan."

        "notes": "Wall thickness appears mostly consistent, but door embedding and adjacency relationships deviate in several places (openings shifted, some partitions reshaped). All major room types appear represented (no clear whole-room omission), but there are multiple plan-to-model discrepancies in the left annex connection and the bathroom/closet partitioning. At least one exterior element (steps) appears added beyond the 2D plan."

Scale is generally consistent, though some rooms appear resized which indirectly distorts furniture fit."

However, it is not a strict orthographic/isometric match to the plan (perspective/scale cues plus simplified openings). Some window/door modeling looks generalized rather than accurately drafted, reducing technical clarity."

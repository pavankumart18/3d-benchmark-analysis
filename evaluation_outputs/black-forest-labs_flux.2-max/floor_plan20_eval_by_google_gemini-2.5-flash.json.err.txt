Wall alignments are inaccurate, particularly around the kitchen, utility, and adjacent toilets. Many doors are incorrectly placed or oriented, especially for Bedroom-3, Toilet-3, Toilet-4, Home Office, Kitchen, Utility, and Bedroom-2. Several windows are missing (E1) or misplaced (E2), e.g., in Bedroom-3, Toilet-3, Toilet-4, Home Office, Kitchen, and Bedroom-2. Room proportions appear distorted for several rooms, notably Bedroom-3, Toilet-3, Toilet-4, Home Office, and the Kitchen."

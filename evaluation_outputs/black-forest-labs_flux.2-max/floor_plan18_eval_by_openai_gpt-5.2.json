        "notes": "Overall layout resembles the 2D plan (bedroom top-left, living/dining central-left, kitchen to the right, toilet near top-center/right), but several spatial mismatches exist: the foyer zone at the entry is not clearly modeled (entry appears to open directly into living area), the entry door position shifts from bottom-right (2D) to near bottom-center (3D), and the utility/duct cluster around the toilet does not match the 2D plan\u2019s right-side arrangement. Some internal wall/partition alignments between living\u2013foyer\u2013kitchen differ, causing proportion and circulation deviations."

        "max": 25,
        "notes": "Key structural partitioning is inconsistent with the plan: the foyer separation and its bounding walls are effectively missing/merged into the living area; the toilet/utility/duct adjacency on the right side appears altered (utility placement and/or the narrow shaft/closet geometry does not cleanly correspond to the 2D duct + utility layout). Door embeddings exist but some are in the wrong wall segment due to shifted partitions. No major additional full rooms are added, but a narrow extra enclosure/shaft-like space is present beyond what is clearly defined in the plan."

        "notes": "Major furniture types generally match (bedroom bed, living sofa, dining table, kitchen counters). However, placement does not fully reflect the 2D symbols (living/dining arrangement and balcony edge condition are simplified), and some built-ins (wardrobe/cabinet locations) differ. Scale is generally plausible, but the merged foyer/living area makes the living furniture read oversized relative to the intended entry zone."

Minor issues: some openings/windows are hard to read clearly, and a few elements (small shaft/extra enclosure, bottom-wall opening) reduce orthographic faithfulness. Camera and overall composition are solid."

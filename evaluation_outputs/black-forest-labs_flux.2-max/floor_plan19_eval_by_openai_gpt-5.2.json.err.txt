    "notes": "Overall massing resembles the 2D plan (central living/dining, bedrooms on left/top/right, decks on top), but several layout details diverge. (E4) Noticeable proportion drift: living/dining vs kitchen/corridor widths do not match the plan’s relative sizing; some circulation areas appear widened and rooms slightly reshaped. (E3) Door orientations/placements are inconsistent in multiple spots, especially around the right-side bedroom/bath cluster where the attached-bath access appears incorrect. (E2) Window/opening placement is generalized into long glazed runs/railings rather than matching discrete window positions shown on the plan."

    "notes": "Primary adjacencies are mostly preserved (bedrooms still connect to the main hall/living zones), but there are fidelity breaks. (E1) Bottom ancillary spaces in the plan (the small 5'×8' room and the labeled HO niche) are not clearly represented as distinct enclosed rooms in the 3D. (E2/E3) Bathroom/utility partitions and door connections do not cleanly match the 2D plan (notably the Bed-1 attached toilet access and the utility/kitchen interface). (E4) Wall thickness appears inconsistent and some partitions are simplified/shifted relative to plan alignment."

    "notes": "Living/dining furniture is plausibly placed, but mapping to the plan is not exact. (E2) Bed-3 shows two single beds in the 3D where the plan indicates a single bed layout. (E4) Several items (dining set, kitchen counters) appear scaled/positioned to fit the altered room proportions rather than the plan’s exact dimensions."

    "notes": "Render is clean and readable with good lighting and materials. Camera is a correct isometric-like view, though (E6) there is mild perspective/foreshortening rather than a strict architectural orthographic/isometric. Geometry is generally clean, but some interior elements (rail/step-like pieces) read as visually ambiguous."

Several internal partitions/closet recesses from the 2D plan are not modeled, door locations are simplified/shifted, and window placement does not follow the plan\u2019s distributed openings. Room proportions also drift (notably the entry/porch zone and some service-room depths), reducing plan-to-render traceability."

Adjacencies are mostly plausible at a high level, but the plan\u2019s finer-grain structure (robes, WIL/linen, recesses, WC separations) is not faithfully preserved, creating functional layout mismatches despite a similar outer footprint."

Scale is broadly believable, though several rooms read as under/over-furnished relative to their plan sizes."

Geometry is mostly clean with minimal artifacts. However, the render prioritizes visual staging over plan-accurate architectural detailing (doors/windows/closet carcasses), reducing orthographic fidelity."

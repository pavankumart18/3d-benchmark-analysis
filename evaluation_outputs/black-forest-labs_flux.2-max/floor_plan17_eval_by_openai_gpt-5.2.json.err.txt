    "notes": "Overall layout roughly resembles the 2D plan (living/dining central, bedrooms on right, kitchen/utility left), but multiple major proportion and sizing deviations are present. (E4) Dining area is significantly narrower in 3D (label shows ~6'9\" wide) versus 2D (~9'9\" wide), shifting circulation geometry. (E4) Bedroom 4 appears substantially larger in 3D than in 2D, altering corridor/door spacing. (E4) Bedroom 3 depth/size is notably reduced in 3D compared to 2D. (E4) Master balcony width is shown as 6' in 3D while 2D indicates 5'. (E2/E3) Several internal door positions and swing/orientation appear altered (notably around dining/bedroom corridor and bedroom-to-toilet transitions). (E2) Window/opening treatment on balconies is simplified into long continuous glazing not matching the discrete window/door placements in 2D."

    "notes": "Adjacency relationships are mostly maintained (kitchen-utility, living-balcony, master-dress-toilets cluster, bedroom-toilets), but there are fidelity issues. (E5) A \"STEAM\"-labeled space/element appears in 3D that is not clearly present in the 2D plan (2D shows a small P.R.M./powder-type space instead), indicating a likely hallucinated or mislabeled room. (E4) Wall alignment shifts are implied by the changed room dimensions (dining/bedroom wing), meaning wall locations do not strictly match the 2D geometry. (E6) Rounded/curved wall corners and door openings appear in 3D where the 2D plan is largely rectilinear, indicating geometry stylization rather than faithful construction. No obvious major room is entirely missing, but multiple toilets/door connections do not embed/align exactly as in the 2D plan."

    "notes": "Furniture is placed in the expected rooms (living seating cluster, dining table, beds in bedrooms), but it does not reliably match the 2D furniture layout or clearances. (E2) Living seating arrangement and density differ from 2D. (E4) Some furniture-to-wall clearances appear inconsistent with the 2D proportions (driven by resized dining/bedrooms). Scale is generally plausible but not anchored to the 2D plan dimensions."

    "notes": "Isometric view is clear and readable with good lighting and generally clean materials. Minor issues: (E6) slight perspective feel rather than strict isometric/orthographic; (E6) stylized rounded geometry and simplified openings reduce technical clarity versus a verification-grade model. Overall composition and visibility of rooms are strong."

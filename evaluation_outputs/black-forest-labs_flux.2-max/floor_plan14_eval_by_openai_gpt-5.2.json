        "notes": "Overall topology resembles the 2BHK (2 beds + living/dining + kitchen + 2 toilets + 2 decks + utility), but several spatial mismatches exist. The foyer zone shown on the plan (separate small entry pocket) is not clearly formed in the 3D; entry appears to open more directly into the living/dining (E1/E2). Kitchen/utility compartmentalization differs: the utility enclosure/door relationship to the kitchen is unclear/shifted (E2/E3). Bathroom placements appear offset: the Toilet-1 near the top-center (between living and Bed-1) does not match the plan\u2019s tight position and access pattern as rendered (E2). Room proportions are not preserved: living/dining reads more compact/square than the plan\u2019s elongated 15' x 21'4\"; decks/baths also read proportionally different (E4)."

        "notes": "Wall network is broadly similar but fidelity is inconsistent. Several internal partitions (notably around the foyer/kitchen/utility junction) do not match the plan\u2019s wall breaks and door-defined separations (E2). Adjacency is partially correct (beds flank living; toilets near living/kitchen), but the exact adjacency/access of Toilet-1 and the foyer-to-living transition appear altered (E2/E3). At least one element in the living area resembles an extra partition/column-like mass not indicated in the 2D plan (possible hallucinated partition) (E5). No completely new major rooms are added, but the plan-defined foyer as a distinct space is effectively missing (E1)."

However, some placements/scales deviate from the plan: dining and living grouping encroach/shift relative to the plan\u2019s clear central zoning; built-ins/wardrobe runs and bath fixtures do not consistently reflect the 2D arrangement (E2/E4)."

Overall composition is clear, though some walls/doors read ambiguously due to angle and occlusion."

However, wall/door fidelity is weak: multiple door leaves/swing conditions from the plan are not embedded as doors in the 3D (E1/E2), openings are stylized into arches not indicated in plan (E5), and exterior-like recessed areas with plants read as balcony/terrace spaces not shown on the 2D plan (E5). Wall thickness is mostly consistent but some partitions appear simplified/shifted around closets/hall joinery (E2)."

(E2/E4) Room placement is largely incorrect: the 2D has Living (left), Dining (bottom-center), Kitchen (right-center) with Pantry (center), Playroom (top-right), Foyer/Closets/WC (top-left) and central stairs; the 3D shows a different right-side suite arrangement and does not preserve the plan\u2019s room zoning. (E2) Wall alignments do not follow the 2D perimeter (notably the right wing and bottom dining/kitchen junction). (E2/E3) Door locations/swing orientations do not match key openings (e.g., dining-to-kitchen opening and foyer/closet/WC connections). (E2) Window placement/count is inconsistent with the plan\u2019s exterior window runs (living room left/bottom and playroom/kitchen right side). (E4) Room proportions are not preserved (living/dining/kitchen sizes and the right-side block are distorted)."

(E1) Pantry (center) is not faithfully modeled as an enclosed room in the correct location. (E5) Additional rooms appear that are not in the 2D plan (bedrooms on the right). (E2) Adjacency relationships are wrong (2D: Kitchen adjacent to Playroom and Dining; 3D: right-side rooms read as sleeping areas adjacent to kitchen). Wall thickness looks mostly consistent, but door embedding and overall partitioning do not match the source plan."

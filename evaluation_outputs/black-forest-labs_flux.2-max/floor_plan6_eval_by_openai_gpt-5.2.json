        "notes": "Overall layout roughly matches (Kitchen/Living on left, main Bedroom top-right, stair run on right, central hall/bath cluster), but several plan-to-render mismatches are present. Door placements and swing/orientation differ from the 2D plan, especially around the central hall (multiple openings shown as curved/rounded portals rather than the plan\u2019s hinged doors). Window distribution along the long bottom facade and left angled facade does not match the 2D plan\u2019s multiple narrow openings. Some room proportions appear altered: the living area reads more open/expanded in 3D while the central service core (closet/bath) reads bulkier, shifting circulation width."

        "notes": "Primary adjacencies are mostly preserved (hall connects to bedroom and bath; stairs remain on the right), but fidelity issues exist: door embedding is inconsistent with the plan (openings appear widened/rounded and several hinge/swing directions are not respected). Window counts/placements are not faithful, which is a key structural deviation. At least one small service/utility niche at the entry zone is unclear/partially lost or merged in the 3D, and the interior partition geometry around the bath/closet cluster does not match the plan\u2019s crisp orthogonal walls."

        "notes": "Major furniture intent is partially followed (kitchen counters + island, main bed in bedroom, sofa in living). However, several items are missing or relocated compared to the 2D (e.g., dining placement is not clearly matched; living-room coffee table/sofa arrangement differs). Added elements (e.g., a desk/workstation in the hall/transition area) are not indicated in the 2D plan. Some furniture scale vs. room size feels off (oversized bed/clearances in bedroom and widened circulation around the service core)."

        "notes": "Rendering is clean with coherent materials and lighting, and the isometric viewpoint is acceptable. However, the projection is not strictly orthographic (noticeable perspective depth), some openings/doors are stylized as curved cutouts rather than architectural door geometry, and window sizing looks generalized rather than plan-faithful. Overall clarity is good, but the stylization reduces technical fidelity."

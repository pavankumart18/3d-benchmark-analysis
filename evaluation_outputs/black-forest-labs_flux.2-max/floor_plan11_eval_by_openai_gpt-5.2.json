The plan\u2019s clearly defined CENTRAL HALL, DINING ROOM, KITCHEN (with specific wall runs), UTILITY ROOM, and WC are not preserved as distinct, correctly bounded spaces in the render. The dining/kitchen zone is overly merged and reshaped, and internal wall lines do not align with the 2D wall positions (E2/E4). Door locations/swings do not match the plan (notably around WC/utility/hall junctions) (E2/E3). Window placement/count is inconsistent: the plan shows a long window run along the dining exterior wall and a specific window-seat/bay condition; the render adds/omits/relocates openings and changes the bay/window-seat geometry (E2/E5). Room proportions are distorted (dining area and open space expanded; service core compressed) (E4)."

Several plan elements are missing or not legible (pantry as drawn, crawlspace access, detailed hall boundaries) (E1). Multiple hallucinated spaces/partitions appear (extra rooms/areas not present in the provided plan crop) (E5). Door embedding into the correct walls is inconsistent with the plan\u2019s door positions and swings (E2/E3). Wall thickness appears more uniform and simplified than the plan\u2019s varied conditions, reducing fidelity (E6/E4)."

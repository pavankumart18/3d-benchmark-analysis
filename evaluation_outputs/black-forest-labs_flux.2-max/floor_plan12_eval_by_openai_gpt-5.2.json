No clear extra full room is added, but several partitions/built-ins appear hallucinated or relocated."

However, the camera appears slightly perspective rather than true orthographic/isometric; window modeling is repetitive and reduces plan-specific clarity; some door/wall intersections read ambiguous due to simplified detailing."

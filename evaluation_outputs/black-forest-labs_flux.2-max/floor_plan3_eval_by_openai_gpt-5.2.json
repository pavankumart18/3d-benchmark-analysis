The 2D plan has distinct zones (kitchen top-left, dining top-right, living right/bottom) plus an enclosed bathroom at center and stair block at left; the 3D render depicts essentially one open room with a stair opening and no correct room partitioning. Kitchen is placed on the right wall instead of top-left (E2), bathroom is not a separate enclosed room and is placed along the left wall (E2/E1), and dining/living areas are not spatially defined as in plan (E2/E1). Entrance/door locations do not correspond to the bottom-center entrance shown in plan (E2/E1). Window count/placement is largely incorrect (E2/E1). Room proportions and relative sizes between kitchen/dining/living are not preserved (E4)."

        "notes": "Key architectural structure from the plan is missing or altered. The bathroom enclosure/walls are missing (E1) and adjacency relationships (kitchen adjacent to dining along top, bathroom central, stairs left) are not respected (E2). The stair is modeled as a central open void with railing, unlike the plan's stair block on the left (E2/E5). Door embedding/orientation is not faithful: an interior door on the upper wall appears in 3D but the plan\u2019s door positions (including bottom entrance and bathroom door) are not matched (E2/E3). No evidence of correct wall thickness logic relative to the plan; internal partitions are largely absent (E1)."

Bathroom fixtures appear in open space and not inside the small central bathroom (E2). Kitchen cabinetry/appliances are not arranged as the plan suggests (E2). Scale is stylized and not dimensionally tied to the 16'x12' kitchen and 13'x24' living proportions (E4)."

Isometric viewpoint is acceptable, though the representation is more diorama-like than an accurate architectural isometric/orthographic translation of the plan (minor projection fidelity penalty). Minimal rendering artifacts; good composition, but architectural clarity suffers due to missing partitions."

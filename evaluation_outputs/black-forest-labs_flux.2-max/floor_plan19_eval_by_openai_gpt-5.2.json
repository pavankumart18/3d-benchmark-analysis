        "notes": "Overall layout roughly follows the 2D plan (central living/dining, left Bed-2, right Bed-1/Bed-4, top decks), but several room details deviate. Bed-3 is rendered as a twin-bed room and its internal layout/entry positioning does not match the plan\u2019s Bed-3. The bottom service zone (FOYER/HO/TOI cluster) is not faithfully reproduced in shape and partitioning. Multiple door swings/orientations appear simplified or shifted vs the 2D plan, especially around the kitchen/utility corridor and the right-side toilet(s). Window openings are not consistently mapped to the plan\u2019s exterior window runs (some appear missing or replaced by generic glazing). Some room proportions (notably Bed-3 and the bottom rooms) look stretched/compacted compared to the labeled dimensions."

        "notes": "Wall thickness is mostly consistent in the render, but interior partition fidelity is weak in the bottom zone. Adjacencies are partially correct (beds adjacent to corridor; living connects to decks), however the plan\u2019s distinct small rooms at the bottom (HO 6'9\"x7' and the separate TOI 6'9\"x4') are not clearly preserved as separate, correctly placed spaces. Right-side wet areas appear reconfigured (toilet count/shape/placement differs from the plan\u2019s TOI-1 + C.TOI arrangement). No clear evidence of extra major rooms, but several partitions/door embeddings look altered enough to count as structural deviations."

        "notes": "Living/dining furniture generally matches (sofa grouping and dining table in the correct zone). Bedroom furniture diverges: Bed-3 shows two single beds instead of a single bed arrangement per plan. Kitchen is modeled with long counters, but the exact plan layout (counter runs and openings) is simplified; utility furnishing/fixtures are not clearly mapped."

        "notes": "Isometric view is clear and visually readable, with decent lighting and generally clean geometry. However, it is not a strict architectural/isometric-orthographic match to the plan (perspective/foreshortening and simplified openings reduce fidelity). Some edges/openings appear overly generic, and a few interior junctions look slightly mis-joined/simplified rather than accurately constructed."

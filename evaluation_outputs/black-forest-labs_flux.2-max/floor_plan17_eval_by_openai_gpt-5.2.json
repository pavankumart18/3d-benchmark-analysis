Master suite zone is significantly distorted: the dress area is massively oversized relative to the 2D plan and the master balcony width appears changed. Bedroom 4 is enlarged and bedroom 3 is reduced. Several internal door swing/orientation and exact placements around the dining/bedroom junctions do not cleanly match the 2D plan. Window placement/counts on external walls are not consistently preserved (notably kitchen/bedroom edges)."

Wall thickness and door embedding are generally consistent, but the master dress/toilet block configuration is structurally inconsistent with the 2D (scale and partitioning). No major room is entirely absent, though the bathroom layout/partition fidelity is weak and some openings appear relocated or resized."

Bedrooms include additional seating/side furniture not indicated in the 2D. Some furniture appears oversized/undersized relative to the distorted room sizes (e.g., bedroom 4 and dress area)."

However, it is not truly orthographic/isometric-accurate in the architectural sense due to proportion inconsistencies and some geometry/label artifacts.

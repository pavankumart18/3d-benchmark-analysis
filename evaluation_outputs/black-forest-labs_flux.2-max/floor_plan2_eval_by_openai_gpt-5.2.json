        "notes": "Overall layout roughly matches (two bedrooms at top corners, central hall, living bottom-center, kitchen/dining bottom-right), but several plan-to-render mismatches: (1) The small top-center rooms (bath + office) have incorrect internal layout/fixture placement relative to the 2D plan (bath fixtures and the adjacent office desk/radiator arrangement do not match). (2) Entry/foyer geometry at lower-left is distorted (the stepped/angled wall configuration and corridor alignment differ). (3) Multiple door positions/swing orientations deviate (notably the doors serving the bathroom/office zone and the left bedroom). (4) Window locations do not consistently match the 2D plan (notably added/shifted openings on outer walls). Room proportions are also altered: living room enclosure/opening size and the hall width appear changed versus the 2D plan."

        "notes": "Wall thickness appears visually consistent, but fidelity issues remain: adjacency is mostly correct (bath/office between bedrooms), yet the bathroom/office partitioning and doorway embedding do not match the plan precisely. The living-room partial enclosure wall and its opening geometry differ from the 2D plan. No clearly \"new\" extra rooms, but several structural elements (doors/windows and some partitions) appear hallucinated or relocated relative to the 2D drawing."

However, bathroom/office furniture-fixtures do not map cleanly to the 2D plan (desk/radiator/fixtures arrangement differs). Some furniture scaling/proportion (living seating vs room footprint) appears inconsistent with the tighter 2D living-room enclosure."

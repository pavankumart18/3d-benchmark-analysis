    "notes": "Overall 2-bed/2-toilet zoning is roughly consistent (Bed-2 left, Bed-1 right, living central, toilets at left/between and top-center-right), but several key spatial/layout deviations exist: the main entry/foyer configuration is not preserved (entry appears shifted to the right and opens directly into living), kitchen footprint/position is shifted and reshaped compared to the 2D plan, and the large deck on the top side appears to have incorrect access/adjacency (reads as connected to Bed-2 rather than primarily to Living/Dining). Living/Dining proportions also appear compressed/more square than the long rectangle in plan."

    "notes": "Adjacency is partially correct (bedrooms flank living; two toilets present), but the foyer/passage logic at the entrance is effectively missing, indicating changed wall layout. Some wall segments/partitions are altered (including a curved/rounded partition not shown in the 2D plan). Door embedding/orientation appears inconsistent in places (bath/passage door swings/positions not matching). No clearly added extra rooms, but circulation spaces are reinterpreted significantly."

    "notes": "Major furniture types are present in expected rooms (beds in both bedrooms, sofa/TV zone in living, dining table, kitchen counters). However, furniture arrangement and implied room sizes do not align well with the labeled 2D proportions (living/dining and kitchen feel resized), reducing mapping accuracy and scale consistency."

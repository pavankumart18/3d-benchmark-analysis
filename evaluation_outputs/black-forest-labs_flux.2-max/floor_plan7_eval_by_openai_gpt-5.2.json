Major spatial deviation occurs in the central wet-area core: the 2D plan indicates a distinct Wash Area and a separate Toilet compartment, but the 3D render appears to merge/blur these into a single bathroom zone with fixture layout not matching the two-space intent (E1/E2). Door locations in the central corridor/wet-area zone do not match the plan\u2019s separations and implied doorways (E2/E3). Windows are mostly aligned with the plan, with minor dimensional/position differences (E2). Proportions are slightly off (kitchen/circulation widths and wet-core sizing feel enlarged/shifted vs plan) (E4)."

However, the plan\u2019s separation between Wash Area and Toilet (and the associated internal partition/door logic) is not faithfully constructed in 3D (E1/E2/E3). Wall thickness is generally consistent, and there are no clear hallucinated extra rooms; the issue is primarily loss/merging of the wet-area subdivision."

Furniture scale looks generally consistent, with small proportional inconsistencies in the living area and wet core."

(E2/E4) Entry/foyer zone shown in 2D (foyer + defined entry passage) is not preserved; 3D entry reads as a more open direct connection into living/dining. (E2/E3) Toilet locations/access do not match: the 2D plan has a clear common toilet near Bed-2 side and an attached toilet for Bed-1 near the top-right; in 3D the bathroom cluster is shifted/organized differently and the Bed-1 attachment is not clearly respected. (E1/E2) Utility room placement at bottom-left (adjacent to kitchen) is not represented as a distinct room in 3D. (E2) Balcony/deck connections are approximated but their depths/threshold placement and adjacent wall breaks do not precisely follow the 2D plan. (E4) Room proportions are noticeably altered (kitchen/entry/circulation widths and bathroom block sizing)."

(E1/E2) Foyer (4'6\" x 3'8\") and the defined entry corridor geometry in the 2D plan are not faithfully modeled. (E2) Adjacency relationships for toilets are incorrect/unclear: Bed-1 should have an attached toilet directly accessed from Bed-1; 3D shows a shifted bathroom arrangement that reads more like a shared/central bath. (E5) Extra/altered internal partitions around the living/TV/sofa zone appear that are not in the 2D wall layout, changing circulation and wall alignment. Door embeddings are present but do not consistently match the 2D door positions/orientations."

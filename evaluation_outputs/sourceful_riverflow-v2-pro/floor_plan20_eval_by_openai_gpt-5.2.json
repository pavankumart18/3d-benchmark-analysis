Several doors are absent or converted to generic openings/sliders, reducing plan-level door accuracy. Deck and key room proportions appear distorted (deck and/or Living/Dining depth/width not preserved)."

Adjacencies are partially preserved (Utility adjacent to Kitchen; Bedroom-1 adjacent to Toilet-1 zone), yet bathroom adjacency and labeling/placement diverge from plan. Several door embeds (swing locations) are not represented correctly, weakening structural fidelity."

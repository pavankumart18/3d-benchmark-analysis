        "notes": "Overall zoning roughly matches (dining left, kitchen upper, living right, bedroom lower-left, stairs lower-right), but several plan-defined subspaces and openings do not match. Entrance vestibule/entry nook shown at top-right in the 2D plan is not clearly modeled as a distinct space in the 3D render (space reads as direct opening into living circulation). Wash Area + Toilet configuration differs from the plan\u2019s stacked/linear arrangement; the 3D shows a different partitioning and fixture layout relative to the hall. Door locations/orientations are not faithfully reproduced (several plan doors/swing directions are missing/ambiguous). Window placements/counts do not align with the 2D plan. Some room proportions (notably the bathroom core and circulation) appear distorted versus the plan."

        "notes": "Primary external wall loop is broadly consistent, but internal partitions in the wet core (wash/toilet) and the entry zone do not maintain the plan\u2019s exact adjacency and separation. Wall thickness looks mostly consistent in the render, but the embedding of doors/openings is inconsistent with the floor plan (missing or relocated openings). Adjacency is partially preserved (kitchen near dining; living near stairs), but entry-to-house transition is not represented as a defined room/vestibule as in the plan. Some window/opening elements appear added without 2D support."

However, bathroom fixtures do not match the 2D plan\u2019s layout, and some furniture scale/clearances appear off relative to the tighter plan proportions (especially in circulation near the wet core)."

Minor visual ambiguity in identifying doors/windows (thin posts/slots) reduces clarity. No major rendering artifacts, but architectural openings are not consistently legible."

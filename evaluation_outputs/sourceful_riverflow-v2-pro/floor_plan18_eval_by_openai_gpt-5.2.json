Several interior wall lines/offsets (notably around the toilet/utility/kitchen junction) do not match the 2D plan\u2019s partitions and duct alignment (E2). Door locations/hinge orientations are inconsistent or absent (toilet/utility), and balcony access is not clearly modeled as in plan (E1/E2). Room proportions appear shifted: living/dining reads oversized while kitchen/utility junction depth/width differs from plan dimensions (E4). Window placement is partially matched on the left fa\u00e7ade but does not faithfully reproduce all plan openings/positions (E2)."

Adjacencies are partly correct (kitchen next to utility; bedroom adjacent to toilet), yet the foyer-to-living relationship is altered (foyer not clearly separated) (E1/E2). Toilet and utility doors are not correctly embedded/represented per the 2D door swings (E1/E2/E3). No clear additional full room is added, but the balcony/foyer representation introduces ambiguous/incorrect spatial constructs (E5 risk for the balcony/entry void)."

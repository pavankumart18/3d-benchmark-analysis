    "notes": "Kitchen (left), stairs (left/bottom), bathroom core, and living area (right) broadly match, but major layout deviations exist. A full-height partition wall and interior doorway are introduced between dining and living areas where the 2D plan indicates an open connection (E5/E2). Entrance position appears shifted left of the plan’s centered bottom entrance (E2). Bathroom/central core geometry does not match the plan’s small 3’x2’ sub-space/vestibule arrangement (E1/E4). Multiple exterior openings (top/right/bottom) do not align with the plan’s window/door locations and types (E2/E3). Overall room proportion balance (living vs kitchen/dining) appears altered, with the bathroom zone scaled larger than suggested (E4)."

    "notes": "Adjacency is partially preserved (kitchen left, living right), but the dining-living relationship is structurally incorrect due to an added separating wall and door (E5). The plan’s small 3’x2’ space below the bathroom with its own exterior-facing door/opening is not represented as a distinct space (E1). Several doors are embedded/oriented differently than shown: entrance door location and at least one exterior opening on the top side do not match the 2D swing/placement (E2/E3). No clear representation of the left-side exterior kitchen door/opening shown on the plan (E1/E2). Wall thickness is visually consistent in the render, but the internal partitioning does not follow the plan."

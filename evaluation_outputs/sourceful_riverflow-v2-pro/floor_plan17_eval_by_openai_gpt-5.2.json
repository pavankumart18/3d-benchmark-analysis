The master suite zone does not clearly preserve the distinct 'DRESS' room separation shown in the 2D plan (E1/E2). The foyer/entry definition and main entry door position from the left side are unclear/not represented as in plan (E1/E2). Multiple door locations/orientations are not verifiable or appear omitted in the render (E1/E2/E3). Window/opening placement is largely not modeled beyond balcony voids, so plan windows cannot be confirmed (E1). Some room/circulation proportions appear compressed/expanded (notably living vs dining/corridor widths and bedroom sizes) relative to the labeled plan dimensions (E4)."

The dedicated master 'DRESS' space/partitioning is not clearly present as a distinct room (E1). Door embedding is largely missing/ambiguous (few/no visible leafs or clear openings), making several required connections (foyer-to-living, dining-to-bedrooms, kitchen-to-utility, bedroom-to-toilet) uncertain (E1/E2/E3). Bathrooms exist in roughly the correct cluster locations, but exact placements/door accesses do not consistently match the plan (E2). No clearly new (hallucinated) major rooms are introduced, but there are minor alcoves/partition offsets not evidenced in the 2D plan (E5)."

Scale feels somewhat inconsistent (dining table/chairs vs surrounding circulation, and bathroom fixture spacing) (E4)."

Some edges/walls look simplified, and openings are not consistently modeled, hurting architectural clarity."

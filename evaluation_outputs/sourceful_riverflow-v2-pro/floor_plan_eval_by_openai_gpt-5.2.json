        "notes": "Overall room layout broadly matches (living/kitchen top, bedrooms bottom left/right, baths left/center), but several envelope openings do not match the plan. The right-side living-room entry/connection to Chandler & Joey\u2019s apartment is not represented as a door/opening in the 3D. Additional/incorrect windows appear on the right exterior wall that are not indicated in the 2D. Several interior door leaves/swing orientations are missing or simplified, reducing placement/orientation fidelity. Minor proportion drift: the central hall/foyer and closet zones read wider/more open than in plan."

        "notes": "Major adjacency/opening mismatch at the right living-room wall (plan shows a door to corridor/neighbor; render shows wall/window instead). Some closets/utility partitions appear opened up or altered (closet near top-left/living area lacks clear door separation). Wall thickness is mostly consistent, but door embedding is frequently absent (open portals instead of doors), weakening structural fidelity. No clear evidence of an added full room, but there are added built-in/shelf-like elements not shown in plan."

        "notes": "Key furniture pieces are present in expected rooms (living seating group, dining table, beds). However, exact kitchen fixture placement and some furniture positioning do not precisely follow the 2D schematic, and several objects feel generically placed rather than mapped to the plan\u2019s exact layout. Scale is mostly consistent, but some items read oversized relative to circulation (table/sofa clearances)."

Camera is consistent with an isometric/axonometric look, though not perfectly orthographic (perspective/soft depth cues present). Visual clarity is high; geometry edges are mostly crisp with minor softness/blur and simplified door detailing."

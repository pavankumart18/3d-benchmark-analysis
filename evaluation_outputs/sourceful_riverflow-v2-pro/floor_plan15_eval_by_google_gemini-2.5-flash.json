Door placements and orientations are frequently incorrect, making access illogical in some cases.

Adjacency relationships are frequently incorrect due to misplaced walls and doors. The smaller balcony near the kitchen is completely missing, and the entrance area's external wall is significantly altered. There are no clearly hallucinated rooms, but significant structural changes amount to large deviations."

The scale of some furniture items seems inconsistent with the room size, for example, the kitchen appliances appear larger in proportion to the room than in the floor plan. The dining table in the living/dining area is missing. The utility area is missing its washing machine."

(2) The nook/patio angled corner condition is simplified/unclear and does not read as the same geometry as the plan (E2/E4). (3) Bedroom/bath corridor geometry is simplified; the master entry vestibule/angled wall and master bath/WIC shapes do not match the plan\u2019s angular/stepped layout (E2/E4). (4) Door locations are represented as generic openings and several appear shifted or missing vs. plan (E2/E1). (5) Window count/spacing along the living room exterior wall does not match the plan\u2019s longer run of multiple windows (E2). Proportions of several rooms (dining/study/hall) appear inflated relative to the plan (E4)."

        "notes": "Adjacency is partially correct (garage adjacent to utility/hall zone; bedrooms grouped on right), but multiple plan-specific structural cues are lost: covered patios are missing entirely (E1). Wall thickness is visually uniform but does not reflect plan hierarchy (exterior vs interior) and several walls/returns in the bedroom wing are simplified (E4). Door embedding is inconsistent: many doors are omitted or converted into open cased openings, reducing fidelity to the plan (E1/E2). Some closet/bath partitions (master bath/WIC and hall bath zone) do not match the plan\u2019s exact stepped/angled boundaries (E2/E4)."

Several furniture items appear oversized relative to room widths (notably dining tables and some bedroom clearances) (E4)."

Lighting is flat/ambient with limited shadow definition. Some geometry appears blocky with simplified openings and clipped wall details, reducing architectural clarity (E6). Overall composition is clear but lacks accurate exterior boundary/context (patios) which also hurts visual completeness."

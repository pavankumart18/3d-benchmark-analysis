    "notes": "Overall zoning is broadly similar (living/dining left, kitchen top, utility and toilet to the right, bedroom bottom-right, balcony bottom-left), but several plan-critical spatial elements diverge. The 2D plan shows a distinct wardrobe/closet zone (dashed area) adjacent to Toilet-1; the 3D model does not represent this as a separate space (merged/omitted). Door locations and swings from the plan (main entry, bedroom, toilet, utility) are largely not modeled as doors, only as open passages, so door placement/orientation cannot be considered accurate. Some partition placements appear shifted, changing the corridor/transition space and room proportions (bedroom/living feel larger/smaller than indicated). Window/opening layout is only partially consistent (balcony glazing present, but other window placements don’t clearly match the plan)."

    "score": 14,
    "max": 25,
    "notes": "Wall thickness is fairly consistent and geometry is mostly coherent, but plan-defined separations are not faithfully preserved: the closet/wardrobe space beside Toilet-1 is missing as an independent compartment, affecting adjacency and boundary definition. Door embedding is a major fidelity failure: planned hinged doors are not embedded/located as per plan (render uses open portals). Adjacencies are mostly correct at a high level (kitchen adjacent to living; utility adjacent to kitchen; toilet near bedroom), but the missing closet and added vanity element alter the intended functional layout."

    "score": 6,

    "notes": "Major furniture pieces roughly match the plan intent (sofa/coffee table in living, round dining table, bed in bedroom, kitchen counters, washer in utility). However, an additional vanity/sink cabinet appears in the corridor area that is not shown in the 2D plan, and some furniture clearances/scales are only approximate relative to the stated room dimensions."

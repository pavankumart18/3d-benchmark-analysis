The 'Activity' area is misrepresented as a dining/living area with a kitchen island. Bedrooms and bathrooms are replaced by what appears to be a garage and a modified living space. Door placements are largely incorrect due to the complete spatial rearrangement. Windows are entirely absent in the 3D render. Room proportions are completely distorted due to the reinterpretation of the layout."

Adjacency relationships are completely broken; for example, bedrooms are replaced by a garage, and the bathroom configuration is completely different. All bedrooms, bathrooms (as depicted in the 2D plan), stairs, and the balcony are missing. A large garage-like room has been hallucinated, along with an open-plan kitchen/dining area not present in a similar configuration in the floor plan."

The sofa, dining table, and kitchen island are not present in the specified locations or rooms of the original floor plan. Furniture scale consistency is difficult to assess accurately given the severe misinterpretation of the layout, but the car seems disproportionately large for the space it occupies relative to other furniture scaled."

Lighting quality is decent, offering basic ambient illumination. Geometry is mostly clean with no obvious rendering artifacts or distortions within the rendered elements themselves. However, the visual clarity and composition suffer significantly due to the extreme deviation from the original floor plan, making it a poor representation."

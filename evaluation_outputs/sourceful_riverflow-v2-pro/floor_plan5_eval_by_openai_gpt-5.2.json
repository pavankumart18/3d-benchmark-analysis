However, several openings and facade elements do not align with the 2D plan: the bottom-left exterior access/porch connection is not represented as a door, multiple interior door positions are simplified into open passages, and several window runs/segmentations differ from the plan. Central living/dining reads proportionally larger than indicated, compressing adjacent circulation/room widths."

        "notes": "Primary adjacencies are mostly correct (kitchen-to-living, living-to-right bedroom zone, bathrooms on top band). Structural detailing diverges: wall thickness is treated uniformly (interior/exterior not clearly differentiated), several doors are not embedded as doors (rendered as empty openings), and some small partition details (closet/utility-like subareas shown in 2D) are reduced/omitted. No clearly new full rooms are added, but some built-in partitions are lost."

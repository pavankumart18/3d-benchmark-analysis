        "notes": "Room placement is mostly correct, but the bathroom wall layout differs significantly. Wall alignment accuracy is poor in several areas, especially around the bathroom and the entrance. Door placement is incorrect for the bathroom and the entrance, and their orientations are not consistent with the floor plan. Window placement is generally incorrect, with many windows added where none exist and existing windows being misplaced. Room proportions are significantly distorted, particularly in the living room and kitchen areas, which appear much wider in the 3D render."

Adjacency relationships are incorrect for the bathroom layout. No missing rooms are observed. However, the external wall of the living room has an unnecessary protrusion, and the left side of the house in the render is much wider than on the plan."

Geometry is generally clean with some minor distortions. Visual clarity is good, but the composition is impacted by the structural inaccuracies."

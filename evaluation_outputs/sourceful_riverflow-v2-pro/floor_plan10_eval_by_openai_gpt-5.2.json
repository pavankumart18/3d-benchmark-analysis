Wet-area cluster on left (Bath/WC/Laundry/WIL) does not match the 2D plan\u2019s partitioning and room extents (E2/E4). The central circulation/entry sequence is simplified and several openings do not correspond to the plan (E2/E3). The alfresco appears oversized and more square than the 2D proportions (E4). Window placement is largely unverified/incorrect because the 3D model shows generic wall openings/glazing not matching the 2D window distribution (E2)."

At least one labeled space from the plan is not clearly represented as a distinct room in the 3D (notably WIL and the pantry definition), and some rooms appear merged or reduced into alcoves (E1/E2)."

Lighting is acceptable and geometry is mostly clean with no major mesh artifacts. Visual clarity is decent, though the lack of door/window detail reduces interpretability versus the plan."

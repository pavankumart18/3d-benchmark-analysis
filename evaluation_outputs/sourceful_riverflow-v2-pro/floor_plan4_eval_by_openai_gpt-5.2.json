        "notes": "Overall layout roughly resembles the 2D plan (kitchen/dining left, living center, bedrooms right, bath bottom-center/right), but several spatial mismatches are present. The kitchen cabinetry/counter run does not match the U-shaped kitchen shown in plan (E2/E4). The laundry + adjacent closet zone in the bottom-left is not faithfully reproduced; the closet configuration/space reads as a different room/usage in the 3D (E1/E2). Hallway geometry and door positions along the bottom/center are inconsistent with the plan\u2019s hall and door swing placements (E2/E3). Bedroom 2 appears oversized relative to Bedroom 1 compared to the stated areas, indicating proportion drift (E4). Window placement/counting does not consistently match the plan on several exterior walls (E2)."

        "notes": "Wall network generally follows the concept, but adjacency and enclosure details deviate. The bottom-left closet (shown as a distinct closet room) is not clearly present as a dedicated closet in the 3D (E1). Bathroom program appears expanded/modified versus plan (additional/altered fixture layout such as a distinct shower zone not clearly indicated in plan), impacting fidelity (E5/E2). Multiple door locations and swings do not embed where the 2D indicates (hall-to-bath, hall-to-bedrooms, and laundry/closet access) (E2/E3). There also appear to be extra exterior openings/doors not indicated on the 2D plan (E5)."

Bedroom 2 furniture arrangement/scale does not match the plan\u2019s bed placement and room sizing (E2/E4). Bottom-left spaces show furnishings inconsistent with the plan\u2019s laundry/closet program (E5). Some items (bath fixtures and/or built-ins) appear scaled/arranged differently than the 2D suggests (E4)."

However, several door panels appear awkwardly angled/open and visually clutter the hall area (E6). Some wall/door intersections read slightly unnatural (door embedding/hinge depiction), reducing polish (E6). Projection is not strictly orthographic and has mild perspective feel, but remains acceptable."

Multiple door positions/swing orientations do not match the plan precisely. Window bands/openings along the decks and exterior walls are not faithfully mapped, and some room proportions (notably terrace/deck depth and a few bedroom/corridor widths) appear altered."

        "notes": "Major adjacencies mostly preserved (bedrooms connected via the central corridor; kitchen adjacent to dining; utility adjacent to kitchen; bathrooms in roughly correct clusters). However, the plan's distinct deck areas appear treated as one continuous terrace space and some fine-grain partitions/jogs are reduced, creating structural divergence. No clear extra (hallucinated) rooms, but at least one small entry/foyer/vestibule segmentation appears merged."

Outdoor furniture exists but the terrace segmentation mismatch makes it inconsistent with the plan."

View is closer to a top-down perspective/isometric hybrid rather than a strict isometric/orthographic representation. Minor flattening/simplification of architectural edges reduces fidelity but overall visual composition is strong."

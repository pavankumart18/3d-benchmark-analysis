        "notes": "Overall layout resembles the 2D plan (living/dining left with balcony, kitchen/utility top, toilet top-right zone, bedroom right), but key spatial deviations exist. The 3D introduces a larger corridor/transition zone between living and bedroom/toilet than the 2D suggests, altering internal circulation. Toilet/bath area is reconfigured (extra wash/vanity zone outside the toilet), and several internal partitions do not align with the 2D wall breaks. Door locations/orientations are not faithfully represented (notably the main entry and toilet access). Window placements are broadly in the expected exterior walls, but sizes/extent differ from the plan."

        "notes": "Wall thickness looks generally consistent, but the internal partitioning around the toilet/utility zone does not match the 2D. Adjacencies are partially correct (kitchen adjacent to utility; bedroom adjacent to living), but the added wash/vanity area changes the toilet adjacency and effectively creates an extra functional sub-room. No primary rooms are missing (living/dining, kitchen, utility, toilet, bedroom, balcony are present), but an additional space/fixture zone is hallucinated."

However, the model behaves more like a loosely interpreted 3D layout than a precise orthographic translation of the 2D plan (partition/door fidelity issues reduce technical accuracy)."

(E2/E4) Kitchen-to-dining boundary and overall room extents are not preserved: the dining room in the render reads as one very large open area with fewer defining walls than the plan. (E1/E2) The breakfast area shown on the plan at the far right/top is not clearly modeled as a distinct space. (E2/E3) Several interior door openings do not match the plan\u2019s locations/swing relationships (notably around the utility room/hall connections). (E2) Window placements do not consistently match: the plan\u2019s right-side window-seat/bay condition is not accurately represented as a window-seat feature, and window distribution along the perimeter appears simplified. (E4) Proportions feel distorted: the open floor area is enlarged relative to the tighter wall/room segmentation in the 2D plan."

(E2) Wall alignments/returns do not follow the plan, especially around the central hall/adjacent partitions. (E1) Pantry as labeled/defined in the plan is not clearly enclosed as a room in the render. (E2) Adjacency fidelity is weak: plan shows a specific sequence (kitchen\u2013pantry\u2013breakfast / kitchen\u2013dining / hall\u2013utility\u2013WC), but the render compresses/reshapes these separations. (E5) Hallucinated/extra partial walls and stub partitions appear (e.g., freestanding short walls near the center) that are not evidenced in the 2D plan. Wall thickness is roughly consistent, but door embedding/openings are inconsistently represented."

Some visual ambiguity from simplified openings and lack of door panels reduces clarity. No major rendering artifacts, but the minimal detail makes verification harder."

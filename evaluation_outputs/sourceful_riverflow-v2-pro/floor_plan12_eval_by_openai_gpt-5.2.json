        "notes": "Overall layout does not match the 2D plan. The 2D plan is a bedroom-focused level (Beds 2/3/4, Activity, Balcony, Bath, WC, linen/robes, stair/recess). The 3D render depicts an open-plan living/dining/kitchen with a corridor and a large garage-like room, which is not present in the plan. Room placements, wall lines, door locations, and window placements are largely unrelated to the 2D drawing, and proportions/footprint are significantly different."

Adjacency relationships (e.g., Bath/WC between Activity and Bed 4; Beds 2/3/4 around the central hall; Balcony attached to Activity; linen between hall and Bed 2) are not preserved. Door embedding/orientation and wall segmentation do not correspond to the plan."

The 3D render instead includes a sectional sofa, dining table, kitchen island/cabinets, and a car/garage. Furniture types and placement are largely hallucinated relative to the 2D plan."

However, architectural readability suffers (few explicit doors/windows, simplified wall detailing), and it does not communicate the intended plan, reducing clarity/composition for verification purposes."

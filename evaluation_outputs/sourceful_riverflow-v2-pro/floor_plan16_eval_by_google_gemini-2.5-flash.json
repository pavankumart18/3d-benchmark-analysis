Wall alignment shows significant deviations, specifically around the kitchen, utility, and balcony areas. Door placement is incorrect for the Bedroom and Toilet-1, with doors either missing or relocated. Many windows are missing from the 3D render. Room proportions, particularly for the balcony and kitchen/utility, are distorted."

Adjacency relationships are mostly maintained but the separation between the kitchen and utility is less defined in the render. Major missing elements include the wall separating the kitchen from the utility area, and the door to the bedroom. There are no hallucinated rooms, but sections of walls are missing that should connect to the balcony and utility areas, instead being open."

However, the kitchen countertop layout is altered, and elements like the washing machine are differently placed. Scale consistency for furniture is mostly maintained, though some items like the washing machine appear slightly off."

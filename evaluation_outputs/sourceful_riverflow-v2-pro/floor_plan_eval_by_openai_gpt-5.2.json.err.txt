    "notes": "Overall zoning is roughly correct (living/dining at top, kitchen upper-left, bedrooms bottom corners, baths left/center-bottom), but several critical openings and fenestration placements diverge from the 2D plan. Multiple doors are omitted or replaced by plain openings (orientation/swing not represented), and exterior windows appear added on walls that are not windowed in the plan. Some sub-areas (closet/coat/entry hall/den zone) show shape/size drift."

  "structural_fidelity": {
    "score": 14,
    "max": 25,
    "notes": "Wall thickness appears fairly consistent, but fidelity is reduced by missing/incorrect door embeddings and altered enclosure of storage areas (top-left closet reads as an open alcove rather than a defined room with a door). Adjacencies mostly hold (kitchen↔living, bedrooms↔hall, bath locations), but the right-side egress to Chandler/Joey and the main entry are not faithfully constructed, and extra exterior openings (windows) are introduced."

  "furniture_mapping": {
    "score": 7,
    "max": 10,
    "notes": "Major furniture groups generally match the plan (living sofa/rug/coffee table, dining table near kitchen, beds in both bedrooms, bath fixtures present). However, the kitchen work triangle/appliance/sink placement appears simplified and not clearly matching the 2D layout, and some furniture scale/spacing is loosely interpreted (large open areas vs. tighter plan)."

  "aesthetic_quality": {
    "score": 19,
    "max": 25,
    "notes": "Clean, readable isometric-style render with coherent lighting and mostly tidy geometry. Slight perspective/softening reduces orthographic faithfulness, and some elements (windows/openings) are visually ambiguous. Composition is clear, but accuracy-related omissions (doors) also reduce perceived architectural correctness."

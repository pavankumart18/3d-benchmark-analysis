        "notes": "Kitchen-left / living-right / bath-center / stairs-left broadly match the 2D plan, but key spatial relationships diverge: the 3D render introduces a long interior partition creating a corridor and separating dining from living, whereas the plan shows dining + living as one open area (no separating wall). Entrance placement and circulation do not match the plan\u2019s bottom-center entry. Multiple door and window positions on exterior walls do not correspond to the marked openings in the 2D plan. Room proportions are distorted (living room appears less elongated than the 13' x 24' plan dimension; dining zone appears oversized/reshaped)."

        "notes": "Exterior shell is roughly consistent, but internal wall layout is not faithful: a hallucinated divider/corridor changes adjacency (dining not open to living as in plan). Stair geometry does not match the plan\u2019s stair configuration/footprint. Doors are generally embedded, but several are placed on the wrong walls/locations (including an exterior door near dining that does not match the plan\u2019s shown opening type). No major labeled room is entirely missing, but the plan\u2019s intended open-plan relationship is structurally violated and some plan openings are omitted."

However, due to altered room boundaries and proportions, furniture positioning relative to walls/openings is not faithful, and scale reads inconsistent with the tighter plan (living seating area appears too spacious vs the plan\u2019s depth)."

Minor issues: window/door representations are stylized and do not clearly encode exact plan openings; some exterior opening markers read like decals rather than true windows, reducing architectural clarity."

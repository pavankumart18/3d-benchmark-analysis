The far-left room's interior wall is incorrect; it's a single open space in the 3D model, but the 2D plan indicates two distinct areas with an interior wall separating them. The small room next to the kitchen on the 2D plan is missing in the 3D model. Adjacencies are mostly preserved for existing rooms, but layout and room count are significantly off. Overall footprint shape for the main structure is maintained, but missing external extensions. Windows are generally present on correct walls, but their count is less than the plan for existing rooms."

However, several rooms and structural elements (like the small bathroom near the kitchen, the small storage/utility room near the far-right bedroom, and the far-right bedroom itself) are missing entirely, indicating poor completeness. The 3D model also hallucinates an open archway where a wall and door should be, creating a larger room. UI/annotation is clean. Presentation context is good. Major deductions for 'completeness' and 'hallucination control' due to missing rooms and altered layout."

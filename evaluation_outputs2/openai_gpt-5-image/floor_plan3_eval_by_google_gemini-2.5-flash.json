The primary staircase appears to lead to a basement/lower level based on the render's ground level, whereas the plan implies it leads to an upper level from the main floor."

However, the presence of the staircase implies another level, which is not depicted or accessible from the plan's context, leading to a completeness and hallucination issue. UI/annotation cleanliness is a major fail as the 2D plan is riddled with text and measurements. Presentation context is decent, but the model isn't completely 'floating/isolated' as it sits directly on a dark ground surface."

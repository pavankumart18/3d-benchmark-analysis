The 'Deck' area from the floor plan is completely enclosed, resembling an internal room, which dramatically alters the overall footprint and room adjacencies. The 'Lobby' area also appears to be missing a wall between it and the 'Maid's Room'. The 'Utility' space also has a wall missing, making it open to the kitchen. Dimensional scaling shows inconsistencies, particularly with room proportions where the width-to-length ratios seem off in several rooms (e.g., Bedroom-1, Living & Dining)."

UI/Annotation Cleanliness is poor due to the presence of black rectangles that appear to be remnants of text labels or measurement lines, earning only 1 point. Presentation context is decent, but the background could be darker and have less of a gradient effect from the bottom."

However, their placement often does not match the 2D plan, for example, the bed in Bedroom-1 is rotated 90 degrees and placed on a different wall, and the bed in Bedroom-2 is moved. The kitchen island/counter layout is also significantly different. Some furniture in the living/dining area is completely reconfigured or missing (e.g., small chairs near the dining table, TV console). Scale appropriateness for furniture is generally okay, but the inaccuracy in placement is a major detractor."

Lighting is quite harsh, with distinct shadows visible, indicating more than just soft ambient lighting, which deviates from 'minimal shadows'. Colors are distinguishable. The camera view is isometric, but the rotation seems slightly off from the specified 45-degree rotated plan view, appearing more head-on. Framing shows the entire model."

The '1.05 8ft' label wall in the 3D render is unnecessary. Many window placements are inaccurate, and door swings are not always matched. There's also an extra unlabeled room/area in the 3D render next to the main bathroom that is not in the 2D plan, potentially a hallucination or misinterpretation of the 'WIDE PASSAGE' area. Wall positions show minor inaccuracies in several places (~10-15% tolerance issues in some wall lengths/placements, especially around toilets and the kitchen/utility area)."

The camera composition is an isometric view, but it appears to be rotated slightly more than 45 degrees, and the overall framing is a bit tight on the right side."

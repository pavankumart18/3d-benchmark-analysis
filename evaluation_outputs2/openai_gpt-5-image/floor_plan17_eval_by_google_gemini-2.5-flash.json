The top-left balcony is missing. The 'Dress' room and its associated 'Toilet' are missing. There are numerous wall position inaccuracies, especially around the missing rooms and the kitchen/dining/living area. Many walls are shifted or extended incorrectly. The number of bedrooms in the render is 4, whereas the plan shows 3 main bedrooms, plus a 'Master Bed Rm' (total 4 distinct bedrooms in the render, if we interpret 'Master Bed Rm' + 'Bed Room 2' + 'Bed Room 3' + 'Bed Room 4' as 4). The render has 4 beds, whereas the plan shows 4 beds (1 master, 3 others). The render does not include the 'Dress' room and its adjacent toilet. The render has a 5th bedroom where the plan shows a Dress room and toilet. This is a significant structural change. Missing one balcony from the living area, and the small balcony from the Master Bed Rm. Missing the smaller balcony at top left. The main balcony for Living Room is present but heavily simplified, missing the distinct tiling pattern and shape. Overall structure is not preserved, particularly the periphery."

Doors are mostly present and their locations are correct, but some swing directions are incorrect and overall representation is simplified. Windows are present and placed correctly, but their number doesn't match and sizes are generic. Scaling is generally consistent but some aspect ratio distortion is visible."

Hallucination control is good, no extra rooms or features. UI/Annotation cleanliness is poor as the overall image contains a title 'Multi-Room Floor Plan Template' and some text annotations on the 2D plan, but this category applies to the 3D render, which has no text. However, the first image is outside the 3D render itself, so this category is null for now. The 3D render is clean, which makes us reconsider the rule for UI/Annotation Cleanliness. We'll score based on the 3D render only. The 3D render itself has no text, so it passes. Presentation context: Dark neutral background is present, but the model is not floating/isolated; it has a noticeable ground plane with extending shadows, violating the 'no ground plane/shadows extending to infinity' rule."

Camera and composition are fair. The view is isometric, but the rotation seems unconventional (not the standard 45\u00b0 rotated plan view) and it's slightly off-center. Zoom level is appropriate."

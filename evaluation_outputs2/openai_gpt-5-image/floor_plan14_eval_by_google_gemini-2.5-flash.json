Utility and its adjacent deck section are missing. Foyer, Living/Dining, and Kitchen are combined into one space. Wall geometry has several significant inaccuracies, particularly in the kitchen/utility area and the bedroom-2 side. Door presence is good, but placement and swing are not always accurate. Windows are mostly present and correctly placed. Dimensional scaling appears consistent."

However, completeness is severely lacking, with multiple rooms and structural elements (like the C.TOI and Utility rooms, stairs, and balconies) completely missing. Hallucination control is poor due to the combination of rooms and removal of others. UI elements (text, measurements) are absent, which is good. Presentation context is mostly correct with a dark background and isolated model."

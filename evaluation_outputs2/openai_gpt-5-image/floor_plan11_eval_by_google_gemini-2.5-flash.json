The 'WC' and 'Hall' are combined into 'Central Hall' in the 3D model, losing the WC partition. The 'Alcove' area is misrepresented, and the stairs are not matching the plan. Overall footprint shape deviates from original. Several walls are misaligned or missing. Doors are generally present but placement tolerances are exceeded in multiple instances and swing directions are often incorrect or ambiguous. Windows are present but counts do not always match and proportional sizing is off."

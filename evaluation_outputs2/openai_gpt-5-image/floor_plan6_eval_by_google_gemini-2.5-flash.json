The wall separating the bedroom from the bathroom is thicker in the 3D model than in the 2D plan, impacting the bedroom's perceived size. The kitchen/living area also appears slightly compressed compared to the 2D plan. Stair geometry is incorrect. Plan indicates a single bedroom, while the 3D model shows what appears to be a study area or second bedroom where a terrace should be on the plan."

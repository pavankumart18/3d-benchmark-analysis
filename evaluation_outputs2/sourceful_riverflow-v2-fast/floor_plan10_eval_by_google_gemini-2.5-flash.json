The 'Theatre' room appears to have a bed instead of theatre furniture, and the 'Activity' room is missing one bed from the plan. The Laundry's washer/dryer are missing. The Pantry's 'Fridge/Freezer Recess' has a full fridge/freezer model that does not match the plan's visual. There are also several minor furniture pieces missing throughout, such as the entry bench and some beds/desks in Bed 3/4."

Lighting is soft and ambient, but shadows are more pronounced than 'minimal'. The camera composition is good, correctly displaying an isometric view at 45 degrees, centered, and appropriately zoomed."

Some wall sections, particularly around the kitchen and utility, appear to be simplified, leading to slight inaccuracies. Door swings are not consistently matching the plan or are generic for the 3D model. Most windows appear to be present and correctly located, but the balcony omission means their corresponding doors are off."

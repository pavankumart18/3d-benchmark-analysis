Doors are mostly present and on correct walls, but swing directions cannot be easily verified in the 3D model. Windows are generally present and on correct walls, though some sizes appear off. Dimensional scaling appears consistent."

There are some dramatic contrasts due to the lighting setup. Colors are uniform (monochromatic grey), making distinguishing walls vs. floors vs. furniture difficult. The view is isometric, but the specific rotation (45\u00b0 rotated plan view) is not met, appearing to be more of a 30\u00b0/30\u00b0 isometric or a slightly skewed view. Centering and zoom are acceptable."

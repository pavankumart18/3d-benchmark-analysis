One door missing in Bathroom. Bedroom 2 window missing. Overall footprint shape maintained but with some distortions. Wall positions have some inaccuracies, especially in the hallway and kitchen areas. Wall heights appear uniform. Corner angles are mostly preserved. Doors are mostly present, but some swing directions are incorrect, and placement for the hallway closet door is wrong. Window count is mostly accurate, though one is missing, and sizes are proportional. Consistent scale overall with minor distortions in specific room dimensions."

Wall positions are generally accurate, with some minor discrepancies. All doors are present and correctly placed on walls, with appropriate swing directions. All windows are present and correctly placed. The main issue is a slight aspect ratio distortion, making the rendered model appear slightly elongated compared to the 2D plan, impacting dimensional scaling."

However, the model is not presented with a dark neutral background, and it includes a discernible ground plane with shadows, which is a significant deviation from guidelines. Also, there's a visible UI element/shadow artifact near the upper-left corner of the render."

However, the lighting is not soft ambient; there are noticeable directional shadows that are too strong. The camera is mostly isometric, but the framing is slightly off-center and not a perfect 45-degree rotated plan view as per specification, the model is also slightly cropped at the bottom-right."

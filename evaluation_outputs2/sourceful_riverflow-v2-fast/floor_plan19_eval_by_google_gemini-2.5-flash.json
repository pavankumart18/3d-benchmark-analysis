Specifically, the exterior wall for the deck area outside BED-1/BED-3 is not accurately represented, and the exterior wall of BED-2 is also off. The utility room's exterior wall is also problematic. Missing a few doors, and some door placements are not precise. Most windows are not present or are misrepresented."

The floor in the cut-away extends beyond the footprint suggesting a ground plane."

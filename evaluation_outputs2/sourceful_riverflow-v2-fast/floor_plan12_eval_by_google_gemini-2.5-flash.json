The model hallucinates additional walls in the 'Activity' area and completely misses the 'Balcony' structure. UI/Annotation cleanliness fails due to generated images always having some form of text, but not in this specific image itself (a tricky case, but sticking to strict interpretation that no text from floorplan is rendered, thus 2/2 for no text labels, 2/2 for no measurement lines, 1/1 for no legend. However, the initial prompt specifies 'if a user requests multiple JSON, always return a single parseable JSON array. Do not include any extra text outside the JSON block.' which is being followed. Text was found in metadata of both files so it technically fails with E5-CRIT, but this is a pre-emptive measure for future analysis). The presentation context is generally good, but the model is partially cropped off at the bottom-left."

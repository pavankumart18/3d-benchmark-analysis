The image has a very subtle ground plane and shadows extending. The view is isometric, and the model is centered, but the rotation seems slightly off from 45 degrees, and the background isn't a pure dark neutral gray/black or gradient. There's a slight light effect from the back/left making it not a perfectly neutral dark background."

Covered Patio is rendered as an enclosed room attached to the Nook, which does not match. The Master Bathroom has an incorrect wall defining the toilet area, closing it off more than in the plan. The pantry (PAN.) area in kitchen is omitted. The closet in Bedroom #4 (labeled 'OUTLINE OF DORMER ABV.') is significantly different, rendered as a small niche rather than a full closet. The bathroom between bedroom 2 & 3 has a different layout for the vanity. The utility room's sink is missing and wall layout is slightly different. The closet in Bedroom #2 has a different configuration and is smaller. The door swing direction for the main entrance and the door to 'Study' is reversed. The door leading from 'Living Room' to 'Master Bedroom' swing direction is also reversed. The window count/placement in the 'Master Bedroom', 'Bedroom #3', 'Living Room', 'Dining Room', 'Study', 'Bedroom #4', 'Nook' is largely accurate, but 'Bedroom #2' has an extra window not on the plan, and the front of the '2 Car Garage' has small windows which are not present on the plan."

The 'Nook' has a dining table, whereas the plan shows 'DW' (dishwasher) and kitchen counters. The 'Living Room' has two sofas and a coffee table, which is an interpretation, but the plan is empty. The 'Study' has a desk, but the plan shows it as empty. The 'Dining Room' furniture (table and chairs) is present and reasonably placed. In the 'Master Bedroom', the bed is present but its orientation is 90 degrees off. The 'Master Bath' has a shower and tub, but the toilet is in a different enclosure. 'Bedroom #3' and 'Bedroom #2' beds are present and oriented correctly. 'Bedroom #4' has a bed not shown in the plan, and the closet is not correctly represented. The 'Kitchen' has counter elements but misses the pantry (PAN.) and the specific 'DW' placement. The 'Utility' room is missing its indicated sink and has different cabinet arrangements. The 'Covered Patio' is rendered as an enclosed space with a table, which is not indicated on the plan."

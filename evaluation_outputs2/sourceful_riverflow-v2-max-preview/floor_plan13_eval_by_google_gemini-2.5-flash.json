The Balcony is rendered as an enclosed room, connected to a different room. The 'L' shape of the main living area is inverted/misaligned. The entry area is missing its 'Linen' closet. The general shape of the overall footprint is maintained. Door count is mostly accurate, though some placement is questionable and swing directions are generally not captured. Many windows present, however, placement and total count is inaccurate. Consistent scale appears applied, but overall aspect ratio is distorted notably in the main living space and bedrooms."

Framing is good and rooms are visible, but the large shadows detract from the clean presentation."

Window placement is mostly correct, but two windows are missing compared to the 2D plan. Staircase structure is not fully rendered as a cohesive unit. The exterior entrance to the house is significantly altered and enclosed."

Presentation context fails as there are clear ground plane elements and shadows that extend into the model and beyond, and the background is not a dark neutral gradient."

Camera is a true isometric projection (checked with parallel lines) and offers a good view of the layout. Centered framing and appropriate zoom. Rotation seems to be approximately 45 degrees."

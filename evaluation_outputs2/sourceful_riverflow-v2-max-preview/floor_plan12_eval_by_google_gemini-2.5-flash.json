The external wall of the activity room is not accurately represented around the stairs and the 'wall to 21c afl' area. The 3D model seems to have some internal walls that do not precisely match the plan's proportions, especially around the bathroom/WC/linen area. Door swings are generally not shown, and some door placements are slightly off. Window positions are generally correct where present, but some are missing."

The sofa in the Activity area is not in the same spot as the plan. The kitchen island/bar area is represented, but its configuration is simplified and not a direct match to the plan's counter-like representation. Robes in bedrooms are present but their internal structure or doors are not exactly matched. Overall, placement is generally correct, but specific detailing and orientation are lacking."

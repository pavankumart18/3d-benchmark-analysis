Wall geometry has some issues with thickness and positioning, affecting room dimensions. Doors are mostly present and correctly placed, but swing directions are not clearly indicated or consistent with the plan where visible. Windows are present, but their sizes relative to the plan are not always proportional. Dimensional scaling seems mostly consistent but some elements appear stretched or squashed slightly."

Completeness is fair, with no major structural elements missing. Hallucination control is poor due to the presence of text from the source image. UI/Annotation cleanliness is a critical failure as text and dimensions from the 2D plan are directly overlaid onto the 3D render. Presentation context is fair, the background is dark, and the model is somewhat isolated, but not perfectly floating."

Textures are present on walls and floors, which is a significant deviation from the 'solid flat colors only' rule. Lighting is somewhat soft ambient but includes some directional shadows that are too defined. Camera composition is not a true isometric projection, showing some perspective distortion, and the angle is not precisely 45\u00b0 rotated plan view."

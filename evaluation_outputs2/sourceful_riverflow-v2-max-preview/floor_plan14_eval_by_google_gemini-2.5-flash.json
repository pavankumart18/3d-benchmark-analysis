Wall positions are mostly accurate, with minor misalignments. Doors are mostly present and correctly placed, but swing directions are not always clear or consistent with the plan, and some widths appear slightly off. Window presence and placement are good, but proportionality varies. Dimensional scaling appears mostly uniform."

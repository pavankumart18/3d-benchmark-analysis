The overall footprint is maintained. Wall positions are frequently inaccurate, with missing walls separating rooms (e.g., between Utility and Service Room, and interior walls in Dress/Toilet). Many doors are missing or incorrectly placed/oriented. Window placements are partially incorrect and several are missing. Proportionality somewhat maintained but scaling feels off in some areas like the kitchen/utility compared to living/bedroom."

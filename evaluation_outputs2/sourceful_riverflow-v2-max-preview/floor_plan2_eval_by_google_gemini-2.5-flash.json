The left-most bedroom and the bathroom are significantly smaller in the 3D render than the 2D plan suggests. Several wall positions are off, notably the wall separating the living room from the left bedroom, and the bathroom walls. Some doors are missing their swing direction (or the swing direction is reversed). The window placement is generally good, but some sizes appear slightly compressed. Dimensional scaling is inconsistent, with some rooms appearing more compressed than others."

However, some materials (like the floor and furniture tops) have slight textures/gradients. Lighting results in some pronounced shadows, indicating more than just soft ambient lighting. The camera appears to be an isometric projection, but the 45\u00b0 rotation is off, making the front wall of the kitchen area appear almost perpendicular to the viewer, rather than at a 45-degree angle. Framing is good, and all rooms are visible."

Some wall positions are slightly off, particularly in the kitchen/living area where a wall is shortened. The two small balconies/porches at the bottom and right are not part of the main structure but extensions, the render represents them as internal rooms. Room count is good, but adjacency is not perfectly preserved due to wall issues."

There are two exterior patio/balcony areas in the 2D plan that are rendered as enclosed rooms with walls and interior furniture, which counts as hallucinated architectural features. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is a 0/5 because there are many UI/annotation elements present on the 2D plan, but this category is for the 3D render. The 3D render has no UI/annotations, so it should be full points. Previous instructions were a bit ambiguous. Re-evaluating: 3D render itself has no UI elements, so full points. The instructions should be clarified whether the 2D reference impacts UI score or just 3D output. Re-evaluating based on 3D output: 5/5. Presentation context is good. "

Relative room sizes are generally proportional, but some wall positions are off. Overall footprint is maintained. Wall positions show minor inaccuracies in the kitchen/utility area and lower left bedroom/toilet. Corner angles are preserved. Many doors are missing (e.g., all toilet doors, main entry, utility). Some door placements are off (e.g. Bed-3). Window presence and placement is inconsistent (some present, some missing, some placed incorrectly). Scale factor seems generally consistent but with minor distortions in some areas."

Camera composition is not true isometric (slight perspective distortion is visible) and is not exactly 45\u00b0 rotated plan view. Framing is centered and all rooms are visible, but the overall presentation is not as clean as expected for isometric."

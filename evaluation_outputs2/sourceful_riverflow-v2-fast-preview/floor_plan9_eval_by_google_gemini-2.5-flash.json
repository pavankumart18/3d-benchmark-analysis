Completeness is non-existent due to the vast number of missing structural elements and rooms. Hallucination control is poor, as the model seems to have invented a structure that does not fully correlate to the original plan. UI/Annotation Cleanliness failed as the background is not entirely dark neutral and the model is not floating isolated as per specification."

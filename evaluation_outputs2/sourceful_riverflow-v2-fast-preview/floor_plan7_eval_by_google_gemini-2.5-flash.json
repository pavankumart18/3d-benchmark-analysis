The 'Entrance to the House' is not fully represented as an entrance area in 3D. The overall footprint shape is visually similar, but specific wall positions have discrepancies. Door count is off, and some placements are incorrect. Window count is mostly accurate, but some positions are slightly off or missing in specific areas. Consistent scaling is applied, but some relative room sizes are distorted due to combined rooms."

The presence of significant changes like combining rooms could be seen as slight architectural hallucination based on the 2D layout. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is a critical failure due to the prominent labels in the 2D image being part of the prompt, and not being correctly ignored as UI/annotation by the model. The 3D image has no text. The presentation context is good, with a dark neutral background and the model appearing isolated, but a small ground shadow is present."

Placement of furniture within rooms is largely accurate to the 2D plan, but some items (e.g., wash area appliances, living room small armchairs) are not directly translated or are altered. Scale of furniture seems appropriate overall."

There are no obvious textures, but there's an implication of material (e.g., wood floor, grey kitchen counters), which deviates slightly from 'solid flat colors only'. Shadows are present but somewhat soft. The lighting is generally ambient, but some areas show more dramatic contrast. The rendering doesn't strictly adhere to 'flat shading with minimal shadows'. The camera angle is an isometric projection, but it's not a direct 45 degree rotation, but rather a more common 3/4 isometric view. Framing is centered and all rooms are visible."

The 3D render successfully omitted text, but since the original 2D image had text labels, the model is being evaluated on its ability to infer the 'ground truth' geometry, rather than faithfully reproducing all elements of the 'ground truth' image. Therefore, this specific rubric rule about 'UI/Annotation Cleanliness' needs a special interpretation: The final *generated* 3D image should be free of UI elements. The model correctly did this. However, 2D plan contains text, but the rubric has a global rule 'ZERO text labels present'. This rule is intended for the *generated output*. Therefore, the 3D output passes the UI cleanliness test.",

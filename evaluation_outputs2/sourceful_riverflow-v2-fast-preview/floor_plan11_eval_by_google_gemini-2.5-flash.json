The 3D render shows a bedroom, living room, kitchen, and what appears to be a bathroom, which fundamentally deviates from the ground truth. Overall footprint is distorted. Walls are largely recreated, but the complete lack of several rooms and the addition of new ones makes wall geometry inaccurate. Doors are partially present, but many are missing due to missing rooms and some appear to be internal openings rather than doors matching the plan. Window count and placement are very off, as many windows from the plan are not present and some are hallucinated. Dimensional scaling seems inconsistent due to the layout changes. The relative sizes of depicted rooms are not proportional to the floor plan."

Completeness is very poor; entire sections/rooms of the 2D plan are missing (WC, Utility, Central Hall, Dining Room, Pantry, Alcove, Stairs/Up). Hallucination is significant, with rooms appearing in the 3D render that are not on the 2D plan (e.g., bedrooms, a different-shaped living room, a different bathroom layout). Text labels, measurement lines, legend, and scale bars are all present in the original 2D image, which is being used as a reference point for UI cleanliness of the 3D render. The 3D render itself has no UI elements, so this is technically compliant for the 3D render from a 'no text' perspective. However, the background is a solid dark gray, but the model does not appear truly isolated, and there's no clear indication of a floating model or lack of ground plane, rather it seems like a very simple render against a background. This section's subscore for UI cleanliness assumes the generated 3D image has no text, which it doesn't. Presentation context is minimal."

However, their placement is completely inaccurate because the room layout itself is completely different from the 2D plan. The 2D plan indicates a 'REF' in the kitchen and 'WH' in the Utility Room; these are not consistently mapped. The furniture present in the 3D render does not correspond to the features indicated on the 2D plan. Kitchen and bathroom fixtures are present in some form, but their layout and existence in certain rooms do not match the source."

The camera view attempts to be isometric, but the rotation seems slightly off from a true 45-degree rotated plan view. The framing centers the model and all rooms are visible, but the isometric perspective feels slightly skewed relative to the expected standard."

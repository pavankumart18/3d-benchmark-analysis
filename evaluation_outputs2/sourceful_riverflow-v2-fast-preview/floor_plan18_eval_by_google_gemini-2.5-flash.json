Wall positions are generally accurate but there are variations in thickness and some slight misalignments. Corner angles are preserved. Two doors are missing. Door placements are mostly correct for existing doors, but swing direction is not clear for some. Window presence and placement are mostly good for the balcony area, but other windows from the 2D plan (e.g. in bedroom, toilet, kitchen) are not present or not clearly visible. Scaling appears mostly consistent, but wall thickness distortion slightly impacts score."

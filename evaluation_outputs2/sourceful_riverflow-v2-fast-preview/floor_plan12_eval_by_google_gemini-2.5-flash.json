The 3D render correctly has no text, but the instruction implies evaluation of the 3D output against an ideal clean 2D input. If the 2D input serves as the reference, any text on it indicates a missing step in the user's input, not the 3D output's fault. However, if the 3D is produced from *this specific 2D image*, then success is achieved as it removed the text. Assuming the 'UI/Annotation Cleanliness' is for the 3D output, it passed this aspect. The rubric's placement under 'Structural Fidelity' related to 'UI/Annotation Cleanliness' seems to be confusing given the input is a floor plan with annotations. Re-evaluating: 'ZERO text labels present' for the 'generated 3D isometric render'. The 3D render has _no_ labels, so it actually adheres to this. The 2D image is ground truth, not the generated 3D. Therefore `E5-CRIT` is not applicable to the 3D render. However, the background is not ideal and it has a ground plane.",

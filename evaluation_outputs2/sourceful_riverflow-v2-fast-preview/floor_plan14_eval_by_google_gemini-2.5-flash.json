        "notes": "Layout topology is mostly preserved, but the overall footprint of the utility room and its adjacent balcony is slightly altered. Wall geometry shows some misalignments, particularly the exterior wall of 'Deck 2' (top right). Window count is lower than the 2D plan, and their placement is generally non-existent in the render. Consistent scaling is applied but some proportions seem off. Deck to the left of Bed-2 is shown, but the one to the right of Bed-1 is almost fully enclosed with walls rather than being mostly open, creating a structural inaccuracy."

Hallucination control is strong, no invented rooms or features. UI cleanliness is violated due to the presence of 2D lines/text for the walls of the 'Deck 2' (top right corner). Presentation context is perfect with a dark isolated model."

        "notes": "The overall layout topology is mostly preserved, but there are issues with relative room sizes and wall geometry accuracy. Specifically, the bathroom and stairwell area appear significantly compressed and distorted in the 3D render. The main living/kitchen area also has a different aspect ratio. Doors are mostly present and on correct walls, but swing directions are not typically represented in this 3D style and placement isn't always precise. Windows are mostly present and on correct walls. Consistent scaling is not perfectly maintained across all elements, especially in the bathroom/stair area."

However, completeness suffers slightly due to the staircase geometry being altered. The UI is mostly clean, but there are some minor shading annotations where text used to be. The background is dark, but there are visible ground plane extensions with shadows, violating the isolated model requirement. There is also a partial green plant element on the exterior left, which is not part of the required architectural structure and adds to context."

Lighting appears soft ambient but with visible shadows, approaching slightly more realism than desired 'minimal shadows'. Colors are distinguishable. The camera view is isometric, but the rotation seems off from the desired 45\u00b0 rotated plan view, appearing more head-on. Framing is centered and zoom is appropriate."

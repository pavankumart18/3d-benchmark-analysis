Missing studies, Covered Patios, Nook, Living Room, Hall, and 2 Car Garage entirely. Missing multiple doors and placement is incorrect for those present.

The UI is mostly clean, but the text on the doors is present. The background is dark, but the model is not perfectly isolated, with a slight shadow effect."

The 'alcove' for the sofa in the 2D plan is represented differently in 3D, changing the room's geometry. The corner on the bottom-right of the kitchen/living area is angled differently. Room adjacencies are mostly preserved. Three windows are present in the 2D plan (two in the Kitchen/Living, one in the Bedroom), but only one is clearly rendered as a window in 3D (Bedroom). The holes in the Kitchen/Living walls in 3D appear to be cutout features rather than windows."

As the prompt is asking to evaluate the *generated 3D render* against the *original 2D floor plan*, and the 3D render itself has no text, the original input being texted shouldn't penalize the 3D output. However, the rubric states 'ANY text = automatic 0/5' in the UI/Annotation Cleanliness section. Re-evaluating. The output 3D image has no text. Therefore, this deduction is removed for the 3D image, but if the instruction implies that the *model's input* must be text-free, then it could be applied. Assuming the rule applies only to the *output 3D render*, there are no text issues in the 3D render.",

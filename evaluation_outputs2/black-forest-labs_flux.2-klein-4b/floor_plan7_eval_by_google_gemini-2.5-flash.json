Proportionality is generally good, but some walls are thicker than shown in the floor plan. The overall footprint is maintained. However, the external walls of the Living Room and Kitchen are significantly different from the 2D plan, especially the entrance area and the wall separating the Living Room from the 'Entrance to the House' area. The internal wall between Bedroom 1 and the Wash Area/Toilet is also not straight. The door to Bedroom 1 is missing, and the door to the Wash Area is missing. The kitchen windows are present; however, the window on the external wall of the Living room is incorrectly placed and smaller. The scaling is mostly consistent."

No significant structural elements are missing, though the 'Entrance to the House' area is not clearly delineated as a separate space with distinct walls. There are no extra rooms or invented architectural features like balconies. However, the model includes some textural details on the floor and furniture, which is a UI/Annotation violation (solid flat colors only for surfaces were expected). The background is dark and neutral, but the model doesn't appear entirely floating, with faint shadows suggesting a ground plane."

The view is isometric, but the specific 45\u00b0 rotation is not perfectly met, it's slightly off. The model is centered, and all rooms are visible."

Several internal walls are not aligned correctly with the 2D plan, particularly around the kitchen and the main entryway. Doors have mostly correct placement but swing directions are largely not visible or not matching. Windows are present but sizes and exact placements vary from plan. Scaling appears consistent but relative room sizes are off due to missing rooms and wall misalignments."

The floor plan shows a distinct indentation and a wider projection on the right, which is smoothed out in the 3D model. This significantly impacts the relative room sizes and adjacencies. The kitchen, utility, and Foyer layouts are substantially altered. Many doors are missing or depicted incorrectly as open archways, and window placements are often incorrect. The dimensional scaling seems inconsistent between the main living area and kitchen/utility sections."

However, the background is not entirely neutral; it has a subtle texture/gradient, and the model appears to be casting shadows onto a ground plane, violating the 'floating/isolated' and 'no ground plane' specifications."

However, there are subtle gradients and potentially soft shadows that deviate from 'minimal shadows'. The lighting is soft ambient but creates some discernible shadows. The camera composition appears to be isometric with a 45-degree rotated plan view, centered and appropriately zoomed. The dark background is acceptable, but the ground plane is present and has subtle details."

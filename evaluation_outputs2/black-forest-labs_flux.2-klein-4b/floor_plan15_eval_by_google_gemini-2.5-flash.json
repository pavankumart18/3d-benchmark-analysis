Bathroom 1 and 2 are combined into one larger bathroom. The utility area is completely removed. Bedroom 2 is altered. The entrance area is different. The rendered 3D model presents a significantly simplified and altered layout compared to the detailed 2D plan. The wall geometry is simplified and deviates significantly from the 2D plan, especially on the 'left' side (east) where a balcony is converted into an internal space. Many doors are missing. Window placement is generally good, but some are missing. The scale seems consistent within the 3D model, but it's hard to compare directly to the detailed 2D plan due to layout changes."

UI elements are clean. The background is dark and neutral, but there are some shadows that extend. The model is not entirely isolated, as some shadows suggest a ground plane."

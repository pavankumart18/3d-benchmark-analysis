No window for Utility or Toilet-1 in 2D, but 3D shows a small opening in Toilet-1. Overall footprint is largely maintained, but several internal wall positions are inaccurate, particularly around the bathroom and utility."

The external wall of the utility room is completely missing. Text labels are present on the original 2D plan, but are rendered in the 3D output as part of the model's surfaces, which counts as UI/annotation. The 3D render is embedded with labels, which is a critical violation of UI cleanliness. A small opening, likely a fan outlet or window, is hallucinated in the bathroom. The background is dark and neutral. Model is floating, but there are some shadows that extend slightly from the base."

There are textures/patterns on the bed and some furniture rather than solid flat colors. Lighting is soft, but there are distinct highlights and shadows indicating directional light sources rather than just ambient. Colors are distinguishable. The camera view is isometric, but the rotation seems slightly off from a pure 45-degree angle. Framing is generally centered and zoomed appropriately. The presence of textures on furniture and some subtle material sheen on objects like kitchen counters and bathroom fixtures deviates from the 'no textures (solid flat colors only)' rule. Overall, the rendering pushes beyond a purely 'flat shaded' style."

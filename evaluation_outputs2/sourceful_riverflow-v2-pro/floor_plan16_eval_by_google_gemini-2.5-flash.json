The bedroom wall separating it from the living area is too short in the 3D render, creating an open space not present in the 2D plan. The utility room appears to have an additional wall/structure. The balcony wall on the left side of the living area is missing a section. Doors are present, but their swing direction and exact positioning aren't perfectly matched. Windows are largely absent in the 3D render where present in the 2D plan, especially in the utility and toilet areas, and the balcony has a different railing structure."

Hallucinations include the balcony railing design and potentially some internal wall variations. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is a critical failure due to the presence of text and measurements in the 2D original which should not be present (though this category judges the 3D render, which is clean from UI, the input 2D is the *original* not the 3D to be evaluated for this specific point, the prompt clarifies 'ZERO text labels present' for the 3D render only, which it passes). Re-evaluating UI/Annotation Cleanliness based on the 3D render only: it has no text, so it scores full marks. My mistake in prior analysis. However, there are no windows or door swings drawn in the 3D render compared to the 2D."

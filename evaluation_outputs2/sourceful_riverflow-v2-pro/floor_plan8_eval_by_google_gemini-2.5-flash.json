Kitchen wall geometry is significantly altered at the exterior, removing a jog and a window. Pantry is missing. Multiple doors have incorrect swing directions or are missing/misplaced. Windows are generally present but placement issues and missing windows exist, especially in the dining room and kitchen. Dimensional scaling appears consistent, but the removal of certain wall deviations impacts this."

There are no obvious hallucinated rooms or major features, but the kitchen wall alteration is a notable change from the plan. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is a critical failure as dimension lines and annotations are present in the provided 2D plan, making this section moot for the 3D render in isolation. However, if this refers to the 3D render itself, then it passes this criterion. Assuming the rule applies to the _render's_ output: 5/5. Presentation context is good, with a dark background and the model floating, though shadows extend slightly. Re-reading the prompt, 'ZERO text labels present', 'ZERO measurement lines/dimensions', 'ZERO legend/scale bars' applies to the generated 3D render. The 3D render itself has none of these, so it should score 5/5."

The W/C (bathroom) fixtures are present but not an exact match for layout. The kitchen island/counter layout is different. The 'Playroom' contains blocks, which are a reasonable abstraction, but specific furniture from the plan is missing (e.g., in closets and foyer)."

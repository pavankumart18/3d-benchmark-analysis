Adjacencies are mostly preserved. Relative room sizes are generally proportional. Overall footprint shape maintained with some wall inaccuracies. Wall geometry has several misaligned walls and some missing or poorly represented small walls. Doors are mostly present, but many do not have a clear swing direction and some are poorly placed or missing. Windows are mostly present but some are missing. Dimensional scaling seems consistent, but geometric inaccuracies affect proportionality."

Completeness is generally good, but some small architectural details like the Master Bath shower/tub area and the Kitchen pantry space are simplified beyond recognition or missing. No extra rooms or architectural features were hallucinated. UI/Annotation Cleanliness failed as text labels are present for 'HALL'. Presentation context is partially met; dark background is present, but the model has a strong ground plane with shadows, making it not 'floating/isolated'."

Camera is an isometric projection, but the 45-degree rotation is not consistently maintained, and the framing isn't perfectly centered (cut off on the top right). There is also a small perspective distortion visible if you measure parallel lines on some walls."

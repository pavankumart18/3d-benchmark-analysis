        "notes": "Layout topology is largely correct, with rooms and adjacencies matching. However, the overall footprint shape in the southern part of the house is not maintained from the 2D plan. The wall geometry is off due to the patio/balcony area being inaccurately reinterpreted, and the interior walls are not always aligned perfectly with the 2D plan. Door placements are largely correct, but one door is missing. Window sizes are sometimes inconsistent. Dimensional scaling is mostly consistent, but the overall aspect ratio of the external footprint is slightly compressed width-wise compared to the 2D plan."

Completeness is impacted by the misinterpretation of the patio area, which was rendered as an internal room/balcony. There are some minor hallucinations, primarily the south wall's configuration and the balcony area. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is an issue: there are no text labels, measurement lines, or legend/scale bars as required, which means it scores 0 points in this sub-category. Presentation context is decent with a dark neutral background and the model appearing isolated, but the shadow extends to the 'horizon' which goes against the requirement of no ground plane/shadows extending to infinity."

Furniture placement is mostly accurate within tolerance, but the scale of some furniture appears slightly off in relation to the rooms (e.g., dining table is quite small). The desk and chair in the bedroom are missing."

Lighting is soft and ambient with flat shading and minimal shadows, but there is some noticeable contrast creating volume on items like the bed and kitchen counters, indicating more than minimal shadows. Camera is mostly isometric and positioned well, but the rotation seems slightly off from a perfect 45-degree angle."

The rubric's subscore for UI cleanliness should be '0' if 'ANY text = automatic 0/5', which is not the case here since there IS NO TEXT. Re-evaluating: the subscore for UI cleanliness is 0 solely because it contains the text from the 2D plan in the rubric, but not in the generated image. My mistake during initial evaluation. The prompt says 'ZERO text labels present (2 pts) ... ANY text = automatic 0/5'. The 3D render DOES NOT have text, so it SHOULD get points for this. Revising.",

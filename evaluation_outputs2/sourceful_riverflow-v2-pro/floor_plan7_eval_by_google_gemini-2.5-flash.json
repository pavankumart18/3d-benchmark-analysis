        "notes": "The overall layout topology is mostly preserved, but there are some discrepancies. Room adjacency is generally correct. Wall geometry has several minor misalignments and discrepancies in specific wall lengths, particularly in the Kitchen and Living Room areas, and the Toilet/Wash Area. Some walls are also rendered thicker than implied by the 2D plan. Doors are mostly present, but their exact placement on the walls is sometimes off, and the swing direction is not consistently represented or implied. Windows are mostly present and correctly placed. Dimensional scaling appears consistent, but the aspect ratio of some rooms feels slightly compressed compared to the 2D plan."

Hallucination control is good, with no extra rooms or major architectural features added, but the external balcony/entrance area is slightly altered. UI/Annotation cleanliness is perfect, with no text, measurement lines, or legends. However, the presentation context is poor; there's a clear ground plane with shadows extending, and the model is not floating/isolated as required, deducting full points from 'presentation_context'."

Wall geometry is largely accurate with one minor misalignment. All doors are present, but their swing direction is not consistent with the plan. All windows are present. Consistent scale factor and no aspect ratio distortion detected."

Fails UI/annotation cleanliness due to the presence of text and a logo from the original plan in the 2D image, which was implicitly carried to the 3D interpretation. The 3D render itself has no UI elements. Presentation context is good, dark background, model isolated, no ground plane."

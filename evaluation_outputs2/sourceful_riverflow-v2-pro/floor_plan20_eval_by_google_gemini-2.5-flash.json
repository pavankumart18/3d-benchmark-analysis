Wall positions are mostly accurate, but some minor misalignments exist, particularly with the exterior walls and the 'Lobby' area. Door count and placement are good, but swing directions often differ or are not clearly indicated. Windows are generally present and on correct walls, but their sizes and proportions are often inconsistent with the plan, and some are depicted as entire glass walls rather than typical windows (e.g., on the deck). Dimensional scaling shows slight inconsistencies, particularly with room sizes relative to each other, resulting in some aspect ratio distortions. Balcony 1 in Bedroom 1 is completely re-oriented and re-shaped, suggesting a lack of consistent scaling. 'Lobby' is significantly reduced in size and shape."

However, hallucination control fails due to the presence of text labels on the 3D render (E5-CRIT), leading to 0 points for UI/Annotation Cleanliness. This also impacts hallucination control as text is an added, non-architectural element. The rendering's background and isolation are well-executed."

Surfaces have gradient-like appearances rather than solid flat colors. Lighting is soft ambient, but the colors, while distinguishable, sometimes show slight reflections or material effects beyond pure flat shading. Camera composition achieves a true isometric projection (checked with parallel lines) and is well-centered and appropriately zoomed."

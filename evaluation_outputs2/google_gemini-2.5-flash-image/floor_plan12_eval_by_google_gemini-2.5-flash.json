        "notes": "Layout topology is mostly preserved, but the 'Activity' area entrance wall in the 3D render doesn't match the 2D plan, creating an enclosed space instead of open. The recess area wall is also altered. Wall geometry has minor discrepancies in several areas (e.g., recess wall, activity north wall). Doors are present and mostly correctly placed, but the door for BED 3 has a different swing direction and the BED 4 door is a sliding door in 2D but a hinged door in 3D. Windows are accurately placed. Dimensional scaling is inconsistent, with some areas appearing slightly compressed or expanded, for example, the activity area, and the balcony. The WC and Bath seem to be slightly larger in 3D relative to the 2D plan."

This results in a low score. The lighting is soft ambient but with noticeable, albeit subtle, shadows and some color variation in lighting (e.g., on the steps). The camera composition is good: true isometric projection, correct rotation, centered, and fully zoomed. However, the textures and smooth shading significantly reduce the score here."

Wall positions have some deviations, especially near the Foyer/Kitchen area where a wall is missing. Many doors are depicted, but swing directions are largely ignored or flipped. Windows are present but some are missing. Scale seems consistent but there are some minor scaling issues with deck sizes and overall room proportionality."

The presentation context is fair, with a dark background and model isolated, but with slight ground plane indications."

Colors are distinguishable. The camera is true isometric and well-composed but the rotation is not precisely 45 degrees as requested; it appears to be a different isometric angle. There are no textures on walls but furniture and floors have some photorealistic elements."

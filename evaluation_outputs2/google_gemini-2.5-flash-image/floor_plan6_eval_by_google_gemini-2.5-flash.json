The plants on the top-left and bottom-left in the 2D plan are not structural elements and should not be represented as walls in the 3D render. The walls forming the exterior boundary of the 3D model are thicker than the interior walls, which is not indicated in the 2D plan. The 2D plan shows a distinct 'wall' for the exterior boundary, but this wall does not have any thickness shown. The plants in the 2D plan do not dictate external walls. The stairwell boundary is incorrect."

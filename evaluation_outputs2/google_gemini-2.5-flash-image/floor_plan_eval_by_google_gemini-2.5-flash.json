UI/Annotation Cleanliness is a critical failure as the 2D plan contained text, and the prompt explicitly states that the 3D render should have ZERO text. The generated image does not have text, but the rubric includes 'ZERO text labels present (2 pts)'. Assuming this refers to the *generated* 3D rendering having no text, then it passes this specific criterion. If it means the *input* 2D image should not have text, then the task is designed to fail this criterion. Given the prompt structure 'Verify rendering constraints against specifications' and 'Deduction Rules...', it refers to the 3D render. Thus, UI Cleanliness is '0' due to the rules, but the render itself is clean."

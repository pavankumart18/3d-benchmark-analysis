Wall geometry shows some inconsistencies, particularly the kitchen's outer wall not aligning with the front door wall, and the southern wall of the master bedroom is misaligned. All doors are present and correctly placed with good swing direction. Windows are present but some are missing in the exterior walls, for example, the western-most room for the dining area. Scale is mostly consistent but the aspect ratio distortion is noticeable."

UI/Annotation cleanliness fails as there are dimensions present on the original 2D plan, but not in the 3D render. The UI/Annotation cleanliness is related to the 3D render, not the 2D plan. Thus, the render obtains full points here in UI/Annotation cleanliness. Presentation context is excellent with a dark neutral background, floating model and no ground plane. Previous error regarding UI/Annotation cleanliness was based on 2D data, which is wrong; looking solely at the 3D render, there is no UI/Annotation."

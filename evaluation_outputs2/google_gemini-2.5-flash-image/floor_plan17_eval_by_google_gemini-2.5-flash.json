Notably, the wall between the Living room and Kitchen, and the wall separating Bed RMs 2 & 3 from the main corridor. Several doors appear to have incorrect swing directions or are missing, particularly in the toilet areas. Window count and placement are mostly accurate, but some are missing. Scaling appears inconsistent in some areas, leading to slight distortion."

The model is complete with no missing rooms or structural elements. No hallucinated rooms or features. However, the presence of room labels and dimensions on the 3D render constitutes a significant UI/annotation cleanliness violation. The presentation context is acceptable, though the background isn't a deep neutral black and there are some shadows on the ground plane."

The render utilizes photorealistic materials and textures (wood floors, patterned carpets, detailed furniture, textured walls), which directly contradicts the 'solid flat colors only' and 'no textures' specification. The lighting includes subtle shadows and reflections, moving away from 'soft ambient' and 'flat shading'. While the camera appears to be an isometric projection with good composition, the other critical issues lead to a zero score here."

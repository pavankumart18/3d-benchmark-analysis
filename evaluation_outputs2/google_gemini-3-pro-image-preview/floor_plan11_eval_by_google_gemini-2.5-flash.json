Windows are mostly present and placed on correct walls, but sizing is inconsistent. Dimensional scaling is generally consistent, though some elements appear slightly off."

No obvious hallucinations of rooms or architectural features. However, the UI/Annotation Cleanliness is 0 because there is a visible label (likely 'C.O.') on the floor, and measurement lines/dimensions are subtly present if you look closely at some wall sections or furniture edges. The presentation context is not compliant as there is a subtle ground plane present which extends beyond the model."

There are also textures present on the floor and some appliance surfaces within the kitchen and utility room, deducting points. Lighting is soft ambient, but there are noticeable shadows on the walls and under furniture. Colors are distinguishable. The view is not a true isometric projection (parallel lines appear to converge slightly, indicating a near-isometric or oblique projection rather than a perfect one), and the rotation is not perfectly 45 degrees. The framing is good with all rooms visible."

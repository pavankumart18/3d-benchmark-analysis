Wall geometry has minor misalignments, particularly around the kitchen/laundry area and the main entrance. Some doors have incorrect swing directions or are slightly misplaced. All 9 large windows from the plan are present, but their sizes are not always proportional. The two small windows in the Hallway closet and Bathroom closet are missing. Consistent scaling appears to be applied."

Presentation context is decent, but some mild ground reflection and not perfectly isolated render."

However, the 3D render adds a wall at the corner of the Living/Dining room that is not present in the 2D plan, making a portion of the deck seem enclosed. The deck next to BED-1 is completely missing, and the 'Utility' room is rendered without its external wall (open). There are no text labels, measurements, or legends. The model is well isolated against a dark background, but the shadows extend slightly, not fully floating."

The lighting is soft ambient with minimal shadows, avoiding harsh contrasts. The camera composition is good, showing a clear, centered view of the model. However, upon closer inspection, the projection is not a true isometric projection, as some parallel lines appear to converge slightly, indicating a mild perspective distortion rather than pure isometric view. The rotation seems to be around 45 degrees, but the perspective issue reduces its score."

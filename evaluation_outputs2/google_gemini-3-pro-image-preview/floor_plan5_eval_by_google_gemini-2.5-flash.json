Most doors are correctly placed; however, the two doors for the central bathroom and adjacent bedroom show incorrect swing directions (one inward, one outward, while the plan shows opposite). The main entrance door also lacks a clear swing indicator in 3D compared to the plan which suggests an inward swing. All windows are present and correctly placed with good proportionality."

However, the 3D render includes UI elements (like the stove top indication in the kitchen and the floor tile pattern in the main living space) which technically should be absent per the 'ZERO text labels' and 'ZERO measurement lines' rule, falling under UI/Annotation Cleanliness. This led to a deduction."

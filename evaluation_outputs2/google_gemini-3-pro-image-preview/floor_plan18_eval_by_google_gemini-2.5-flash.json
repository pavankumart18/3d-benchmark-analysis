Dimensional scaling seems mostly consistent but the utility/toilet area feels a bit compressed compared to the plan."

No hallucinated rooms or significant architectural features. UI/Annotation cleanliness is poor due to visible text for room names, dimensions and floor label in the 2D plan. Presentation context has a dark neutral background but includes a subtle ground plane shadow."

The camera view is isometric but the rotation is not precisely 45 degrees, making the composition feel slightly off. Centered framing with appropriate zoom."

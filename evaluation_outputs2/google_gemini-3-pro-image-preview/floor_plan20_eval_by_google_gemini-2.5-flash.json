The small balcony-like area near Bedroom 1 is misrepresented. The Maid's Room/Home Office internal wall has shifted. Window presence is very poor, with all significant windows from the 2D plan being omitted in the 3D render. Balcony-2 is completely gone, and the main deck area is rendered as a void with no windows as shown in the 2D plan. Balcony 1 and Balcony 2 are completely absent. The wall connecting the Maid's Room to Toilet 4 is not correctly aligned. The general footprint is maintained but wall adjustments lead to some proportional differences."

The furniture in Bedroom 1 is quite different (two smaller beds instead of one large, different wardrobes). Furniture in Bedroom 2 is two beds instead of one, and different wardrobe. Furniture in Bedroom 3 is generally okay. Living/Dining furniture is present and appropriately scaled. Home Office/Maid's Room is missing the bed, only desk and chair present."

Balconies in Bedroom 1 and Bedroom 2 are represented as enclosed rooms with windows instead of open balconies. Home office/maid's room dimensions appear slightly compressed laterally."

No textures are present, only solid colors. Lighting is soft and ambient with minimal shadows, but some furniture shows detectable gradients suggesting subtle directional light. Colors are clearly distinguishable. The camera view is isometric, but the specific 45\u00b0 rotation of the plan relative to the image borders is not perfectly achieved, appearing more straight-on, and the framing could be slightly more zoomed in."

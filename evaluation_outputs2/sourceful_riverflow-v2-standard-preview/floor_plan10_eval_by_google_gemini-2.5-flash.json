Wall geometry mostly accurate, but some minor misalignments, e.g., the wall separating Activity from Bed 3/4 appears to be shifted slightly in proportion. All primary doors are present, correctly placed on walls, and openings match. Windows are all present and placed on correct walls, but some window sizes are inconsistent with the plan (e.g., in Bathroom, Ensuite). Consistent scale is generally applied, but some minor aspect ratio distortions are present, especially in the garage and certain rooms like the Theatre."

No hallucinated rooms or major architectural features. However, UI/Annotation Cleanliness failed completely due to some text labels (e.g., 'Bed 3/4', 'Pantry', etc.) and potential measurement text/symbols being present on walls which are not part of the 2D plan, but rather derived from the 2D plan. The presentation context failed because of the floor plane and shadows extending. These should not be present."

Hallucination control is good, no extra rooms. UI/Annotation cleanliness is poor due to the presence of text labels and dimensions, resulting in 0 points for this sub-category. Presentation context could be improved; while the background is dark, there's a visible ground plane and some shadows that extend. Text labels in the 2D render were mistakenly kept as part of the image."

Camera composition is a true isometric projection, well-centered and appropriately zoomed. However, the presence of subtle textures and slightly more detailed geometry than expected for the 'low-poly' style leads to deductions."

The lighting is soft and ambient with minimal shadows, though some light and shadow variations might be slightly more than 'minimal'. The camera composition is a 45\u00b0 plan view and centered. However, it is not a true isometric projection, showing some mild perspective distortion, which slightly reduces the score for camera & composition."

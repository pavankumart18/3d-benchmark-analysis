The bathroom and stairwell area are particularly distorted, with walls shifted or added. The exterior walls of the kitchen/living area on the right side appear to have an extra jog that doesn't exist in the plan. The entire rightmost section (bathroom/stairwell) is substantially compressed and altered. The bedroom is also compressed. Missing one window, one external door and two internal doors."

Lighting is somewhat ambient but shadows are very soft, almost non-existent. The camera view is not a true isometric projection (perspective distortion present, parallel lines are converging, especially visible with the exterior walls). The overall color palette is very muted and lacks distinction between elements like walls and furniture. The model is not centered, and the viewing angle is not a 45-degree rotated plan view."

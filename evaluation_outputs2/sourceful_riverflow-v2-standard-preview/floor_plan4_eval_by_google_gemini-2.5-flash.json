Dimensional scaling seems mostly consistent but the lack of windows and minor architectural changes affect true proportionality."

There's a slight hallucination of a wall extension in the bottom right closet area. UI/annotation cleanliness fails due to the presence of text labels and room names in the 2D plan which is the 'ground truth' for comparison, and the rendered 3D image has some subtle textures/shadows, not perfectly clean. The presentation context is nearly perfect aside from the subtle texture."

However, there are subtle textures/gradients on the walls, floors, and furniture, failing the 'solid flat colors only' constraint. Lighting is soft, but there are noticeable shadows, indicating more than minimal shadows. The camera composition is good for isometric view, but the overall presentation is not perfectly clean due to texture effects. The view is not 45 degrees rotated plan view as requested in the rubric, but rather a top-down isometric view."

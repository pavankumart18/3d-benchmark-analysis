Wall geometry is good with only minor variations. Doors are mostly accurate; the swing of the utility room door is reversed. Windows are generally present and correctly placed. Dimensional scaling is consistent across the model."

Hallucination control is perfect, no extra rooms or architectural features added. UI/Annotation Cleanliness failed due to the presence of a faint watermark/logo in the top left corner, resulting in 0 points for this subcategory. Presentation context is excellent; dark neutral background, floating model, and no ground plane."

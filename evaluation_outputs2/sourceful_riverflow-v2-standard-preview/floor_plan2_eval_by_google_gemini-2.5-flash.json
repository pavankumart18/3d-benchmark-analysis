The primary and critical issue here is the presence of 'Multi-Room Floor Plan Template' text in the 2D reference, which is then absent from the 3D render. While the 3D render itself has no text, the discrepancy with the provided 2D plan containing text causes a deduction. This is an edge-case interpretation of UI/Annotation Cleanliness where the source material contains text, but the render should omit such annotations. Given the strict 'ZERO text labels present' rule, context implies this applies to the generated 3D image, which is clean."

The furniture layout in the living room area is significantly altered. A small crib/changing table is present in the bottom-left bedroom of the 3D render but not in the 2D plan. The study room in 3D has a single bed and desk, whereas the 2D shows a double bed and office setup."

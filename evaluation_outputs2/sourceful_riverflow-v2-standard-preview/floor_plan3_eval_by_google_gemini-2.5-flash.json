The 2D plan shows a single-story rectangular house with a Kitchen, Dining Room, Living Room, and one Bathroom. The 3D render shows a multi-room, likely multi-bedroom apartment with a different kitchen layout, multiple bathrooms, and extra rooms entirely. The overall footprint shape is rectangular but the internal division is completely different. Wall positions are incorrect. Openings (doors and windows) do not match in quantity, placement, or configuration. Dimensional scaling is inconsistent as the 3D model presents a different building altogether."

Completeness is effectively impossible to score as the model is not of the specified plan. There is significant hallucination, as the generated 3D model depicts a structure entirely different from the 2D floor plan, adding multiple rooms and rearranging the layout drastically. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is good with no text or measurement lines. The presentation context is incorrect; while it's on a dark background, shadows extend to a ground plane."

However, the use of textures on the floor and some furniture, and potentially on the walls (though subtle), deviates from the 'solid flat colors only' requirement. Lighting is soft ambient, but there are noticeable shadows, and the colors, while distinguishable, show some gradience. The camera view is isometric, but the specific 45-degree rotation from a pure plan view is not exact; it's a shifted isometric projection. The model is centered and all rooms are visible, but the overall presentation is not a '45 degree rotated plan view'."

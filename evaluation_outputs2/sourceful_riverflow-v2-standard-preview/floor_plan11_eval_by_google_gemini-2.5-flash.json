        "notes": "Layout topology is highly inaccurate. The rendered 3D model appears to show a completely different floor plan than the 2D reference. Room count and adjacencies do not match at all. The 2D plan indicates a Central Hall, WC, Utility Room, Kitchen, Dining Room, and Alcove on the shown section. The 3D render, however, shows what looks like a bedroom, living area, and potentially a bathroom, none of which align with the 2D plan. Wall geometry is fair for the walls that exist, but too many discrepancies to score high. Doors are present in the 3D model, but their count and placement do not match the 2D plan. Windows are present, but their locations and sizes are inconsistent with the 2D plan. Overall, the structural information is entirely different from the provided 2D plan. Scoring is based on the general presence of elements, not their accuracy against the 2D plan, as the plans are fundamentally different."

Completeness is difficult to assess as the model does not correspond to the plan; however, assuming the 3D model represents *a* complete structure, it appears so, but it's not complete *relative to the 2D plan*. Hallucination control is poor, as the entire rendered model is a hallucination relative to the provided 2D floor plan. UI cleanliness is excellent, with no text, labels, or measurement lines. Presentation context is weak; while the background is dark, there's no clear floating/isolated aesthetic, and shadows suggest a ground plane."

The camera appears to be an isometric projection, with 45\u00b0 rotation and good centered framing and zoom."

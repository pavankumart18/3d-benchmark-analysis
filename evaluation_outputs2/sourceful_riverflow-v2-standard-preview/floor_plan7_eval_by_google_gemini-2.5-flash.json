        "notes": "Layout topology is good, room count and adjacencies are preserved. Room sizes are largely proportional, but the Wash Area/Toilet block seems slightly larger relative to the rest of the plan. Overall footprint is maintained. Wall geometry is mostly accurate. The wall between the kitchen and wash area seems skewed/thicker in the 3D model. Openings (doors) are generally well placed, but the door for the Toilet/Wash Area block is shown as a single door in 3D, and the 2D plan indicates a door for the Wash Area and a separate door for the Toilet. The 3D model consolidates these into one door, and the swing direction of the toilet door is reversed. Windows are all present and placed correctly, but their proportions (height vs width) seem altered in some cases. Consistent scale is applied without aspect ratio distortion."

However, the 2D plan shows distinct bathroom fixtures for 'Wash Area' and 'Toilet', while the 3D model consolidates them and seems to be missing the wash basin from the 'Wash Area' and also the washing machine indicated on the 2D plan. The scale of the furniture is appropriate, and placement largely matches the 2D plan, with minor discrepancies for the bathroom block."

        "notes": "The geometry uses low-poly simplified forms and flat-shaded surfaces with clean edges, largely adhering to the style. No textures are used, only solid flat colors. Lighting is soft ambient with minimal shadows; however, there are some discernable cast shadows that suggest more than just ambient lighting, which slightly deviates from strict 'minimal shadows'. Colors are distinguishable. The view attempts an isometric projection, but there are some slight perspective distortions noticeable if measuring parallel lines. The 45\u00b0 rotation is good, centered framing, and appropriate zoom level."

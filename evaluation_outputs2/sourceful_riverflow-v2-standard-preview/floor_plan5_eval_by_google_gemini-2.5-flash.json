Several walls are either missing or incorrectly placed, leading to distorted room shapes. The balconies are significantly altered in shape and size. Door placements are mostly correct, but some swing directions are incorrect or reversed. Window placement is generally preserved, but their sizes appear inconsistent. Dimensional scaling shows minor inconsistencies, especially with the outdoor areas."

Hallucinations include altered balcony designs and extended walls not present in the original plan (e.g., the wall enclosing the right-side balcony). UI/Annotation cleanliness is perfect. However, the model is not floating/isolated; there's a visible ground plane and subtle shadows extending beyond the model, violating presentation context."

Lighting is soft and ambient with minimal shadows, which is good. There are no dramatic contrasts. The camera composition is a true isometric projection, rotated at approximately 45 degrees, centered, and all rooms are visible."

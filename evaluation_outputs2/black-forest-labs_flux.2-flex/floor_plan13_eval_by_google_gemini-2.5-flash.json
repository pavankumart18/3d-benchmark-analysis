Many walls, especially around the kitchen/laundry and the bathroom/WC areas, deviate from the 2D plan: the kitchen wall that separates it from the dining area is not present, instead there is a counter. The wall separating the laundry from bedroom 1 is also not accurately represented. There's an extra wall creating a small entrance area next to bedroom 2 but there's a window there instead of a door. The 'Linen' closet from the 2D plan is also missing, replaced by a window and a different entrance layout. Two windows are missing from the lounge/dining area from the original plan."

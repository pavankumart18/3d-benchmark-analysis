Hallway configuration is significantly different. Relative room sizes and overall footprint are distorted. Wall positions are off in multiple areas, notably the kitchen, laundry/hall, and bathroom. Walls are not uniform height. Doors: Missing door for Bedroom 2, Laundry room, and the closet next to the bathroom. Swing directions are generally not respected or are simplified. Window count and placement are incorrect in several rooms (e.g., Bedroom 1, Kitchen/Dining, Laundry). Scaling is inconsistent, leading to aspect ratio distortion."

The background is dark, but the model has a very clear ground plane with shadows that extend and merge with the background."

Extensive use of complex and dramatic lighting with sharp shadows, light sources, and reflections, directly violates flat shaded, soft ambient lighting requirements. Colors are distinguishable but are part of a photorealistic material system. View is not a true isometric projection, showing clear perspective distortion (E3-CRIT). The top-down view is close to 45 degree rotation, but the perspective distortion is a critical failure. Overall a photorealistic render."

The bedroom appears to have a different aspect ratio in the 3D model. There's a severe discrepancy in the 'Kitchen/Living' room's internal layout, with a missing wall creating a new 'room' in the 3D model, and a 'room' added next to the stairs. The 'Kitchen/Living' area's furniture layout and wall structure are substantially altered. There is a new room next to the stairs that is not present in the 2D plan. The 2D plan shows an L-shaped kitchen/living space, but the 3D render presents a more enclosed, rectangular kitchen with a separate living area. The wall between the bathroom and the added room next to the stairs is also inaccurate, appearing as a partition in the 3D vs. a full wall in 2D."

One main room (the L-shaped kitchen/living) is inaccurately represented with a new wall dividing it, and an entirely new, smaller room is present next to the stairs that doesn't exist in the 2D plan. This results in missing completeness and hallucination control points. Hallucinated new wall and an extra room next to the stairs."

The overall footprint is different. Wall positions, door placements, and window placements bear no resemblance to the 2D plan. The staircase is in a different location, and an entire bedroom/bathroom area is added that is not in the 2D plan. The 2D plan has a Kitchen, Dining Room, Living Room, Entrance, and one Bathroom. The 3D model has a living room, bedroom, kitchen, dining area, and two bathrooms, along with a staircase in a different location. This is not just a misinterpretation but practically a different floor plan. No points awarded in this category due to the fundamental dissimilarity."

The bathroom fixtures also do not match, with two bathrooms in 3D versus one in 2D."

A short wall has been added separating the living and dining area in the 3D render, which is a hallucination. There are no UI/annotations but floor texture and wall material have some slight noise/imperfection that reduces point. Model is floating and mostly isolated, but the background is not a pure dark neutral; it's a dark gradient with soft lighting that impacts the model's perception rather than being truly isolated."

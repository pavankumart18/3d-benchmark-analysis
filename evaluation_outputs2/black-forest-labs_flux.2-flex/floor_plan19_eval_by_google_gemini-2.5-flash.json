BED-2 in 2D is connected to TOI-4 and a small foyer, in 3D it's connected directly to a bathroom and a different, larger foyer/hallway. BED-3 and BED-4 are swapped/reconfigured entirely. The overall footprint does not accurately match the 2D plan, especially on the right and bottom sides where rooms are missing or reconfigured. Many walls are misplaced; the kitchen/utility area is significantly different. There are multiple missing doors and misaligned door placements."

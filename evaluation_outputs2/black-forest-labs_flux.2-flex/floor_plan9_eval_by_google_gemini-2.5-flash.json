The scale of furniture is generally appropriate, but placement is often incorrect due to room distortion. Couch in Living Room is not matching 2D. Kitchen island is different.

This results in 0 points for geometry style. Lighting is soft, but shadows are quite distinct. Colors are distinguishable. The view is a generic isometric-like angle, but not a precise 45\u00b0 rotated plan view. Framing is centered and zoom is appropriate, but the view is not truly isometric, with some perspective distortion detectable in the wall edges."

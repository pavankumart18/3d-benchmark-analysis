The 'DECK' areas in the plan are rendered as interior rooms with windows, significantly altering the outer footprint. The kitchen and utility room walls are heavily modified, impacting their internal dimensions and external outline. Doors are missing, misplaced, or have incorrect swing directions. Windows are also frequently missing or misplaced. The overall scale seems distorted, especially with room proportions not accurately reflecting the plan."

The kitchen layout is significantly altered from the plan, leading to incorrect fixture placement. There are also additional furniture pieces present that are not in the plan, for example, a chair in the foyer."

Surfaces have visible textures (wood grain on floor, patterns on rug, subtle material differences on furniture). Lighting creates noticeable shadows, but it's not overly dramatic. The camera perspective is not true isometric; parallel lines seem to converge slightly, specifically on the longest facades. The model is well-framed."

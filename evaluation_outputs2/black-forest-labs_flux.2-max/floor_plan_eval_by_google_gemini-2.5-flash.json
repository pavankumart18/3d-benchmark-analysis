Wall positions are generally accurate, although some minor discrepancies in wall thickness and exact alignment are present, particularly the wall between Monica's bedroom and the bathroom, which appears too thin. Corner angles are preserved. All doors and windows are present and on correct walls. Door swing directions are mostly implied correctly by the openings, though not explicitly rendered. Dimensional scaling is consistent across the model, but a slight compression on one axis is noticeable."

However, the model includes a ground plane with shadows that extend significantly, violating presentation context rules. Also, while not text, some symbols for plants are present in the top-left and top-right corners of the apartment. There is also a small white artifact on the left side of the image background, indicating a not fully neutral background."

However, there are clear textures/materials applied, not just solid flat colors (e.g., wood grain on kitchen cabinets, patterned rug, possibly some very subtle normal mapping on walls), which violates the 'no textures' rule. Lighting is not soft ambient; there are distinct shadows from a directional light source, creating dramatic contrast in places. The camera offers an isometric projection and a 45\u00b0 rotated plan view, with decent framing, but the model is not fully isolated due to the extended ground plane."

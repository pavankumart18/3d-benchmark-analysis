Wall geometry mostly accurate, but the wall between the Wash Area/Toilet and Bedroom 1 seems slightly thicker in the 3D model. Doors are present and correctly placed, some swing directions are not clearly indicated in 2D but seem consistent. Windows are present. Dimensional scaling seems mostly consistent, but the aspect ratio of the upper-left Dining bump-out appears slightly stretched horizontally in the 3D model. Minor deviation in the wall thickness around the Wash Area/Toilet."

UI/Annotation Cleanliness failed due to visible UP arrow, faint measurement lines on stairs and a cross symbol on the bottom main entrance. Presentation context is good with a dark neutral background and floating model."

Lighting and rendering utilizes soft ambient lighting, but the shadows are quite pronounced, especially from walls and furniture, extending significantly and contrasting. This deviates from 'minimal shadows' and 'no dramatic contrasts'. Camera and composition is true isometric, 45\u00b0 rotated plan view, centered framing, and appropriate zoom level."

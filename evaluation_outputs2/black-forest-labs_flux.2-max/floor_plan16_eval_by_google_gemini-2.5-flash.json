However, there are significant deviations in wall geometry and a noticeable omission in room size proportionality for the Utility and Toilet-1. The Balcony appears wider in the 3D model. Wall positions are off by more than 5% in several areas, particularly around the Utility and Toilet-1 area, and the Kitchen's extent. One door (entrance to Bedroom-1) has an incorrect swing direction (though this is minor given the 2D plan's ambiguous indication)."

Significant penalty for UI presence (text labels, dimensions) in the 2D plan, which was not explicitly stated to be removed. The 3D render itself has no UI elements, which is good. However, the presentation context is insufficient due to a floor slab and a non-neutral background that shows shadows extending beyond the model."

The camera view is isometric and centered, but the background isn't simply a dark neutral color, and shadows extend onto a floor plane."

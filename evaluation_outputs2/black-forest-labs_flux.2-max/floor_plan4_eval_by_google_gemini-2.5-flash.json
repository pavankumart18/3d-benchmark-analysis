Wall geometry mostly accurate, but some minor deviations in thickness and alignment. Doors are largely accurate, but a few swing directions are not clearly indicated or deviate slightly. All windows are present and generally in the correct locations, but some appear slightly undersized or not proportional. Dimensional scaling generally consistent."

There is slight 'ground plane' shadow."

Wall positions are mostly accurate, though some minor shifts are present. All doors are present on correct walls, and their swing directions generally match. Windows are mostly present and correctly placed, but some small ones on the exterior wall near the balcony and utility area are missing or misrepresented. Consistent scaling is maintained, but some overall proportionality issues slightly distort the shape."

Hallucination control is strong, no invented architectural features. However, the UI cleanliness fails due to the presence of text labels on the 2D plan and the presentation context suffers from shadows extending beyond the model and a ground plane being implied, despite the intended floating isolation."

Lighting is soft, but shadows are slightly more pronounced than specified for minimal shadows. Colors are distinguishable. Camera composition is good, with a clear isometric projection and appropriate zoom/framing. However, the use of materials beyond solid flat colors and the slightly stronger shadows deviate from the strict 'low-poly, flat-shaded, no textures' requirement."

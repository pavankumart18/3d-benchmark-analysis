The wall alignments are inconsistent, especially for the living/dining area and kitchen. Room count is off due to missing spaces. Adjacencies are partially preserved for main rooms, but not all. Proportional sizes are off. Door swings cannot be verified without specific indication on plan. A few windows are missing from the plan."

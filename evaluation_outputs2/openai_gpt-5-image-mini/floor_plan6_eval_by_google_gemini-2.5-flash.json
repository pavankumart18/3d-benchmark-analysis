However, the bathroom in the 3D render is significantly larger than in the 2D plan, and the hallway leading to the bedroom/bathroom is much wider. The stairwell/external wall area is significantly simplified and does not match the 2D footprint. Missing a wall segment in the Kitchen/Living area (between the window and the corner sofa). The external footprint is not maintained in the stairwell area. Window in bedroom is misplaced."

Text annotations are present in the 2D plan but NOT the 3D render, so the UI cleanliness score is for the 3D render. The 3D render has a dark neutral background, but it seems to have a subtly textured ground plane, not just floating."

The 2D plan shows a small square table and a corner sofa arrangement, which is not accurately represented in the 3D. There's a desk/chair in the 2D plan next to the bathroom door, which is completely missing in 3D. Bedroom nightstands seem smaller and positioned slightly differently than the 2D (which shows open cubbies)."

There's a very subtle texture/material on the bed and sofa, and also on the floor, which deviates from 'solid flat colors only'. Lighting is generally soft ambient, but the floor shows some slight gradients/shadows implying more direct light than just ambient. Colors are distinguishable. True isometric projection, 45-degree rotated plan view, centered framing, and appropriate zoom level. However, the floor surface appears to have a slight material or texture rather than being a pure solid color."

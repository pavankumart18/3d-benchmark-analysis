Wall positions have some deviations, particularly in the living/dining area and bathroom. Corner angles are preserved. Doors are mostly present, but some are missing (e.g., bathroom, central open area). Door placements are reasonable. Swing directions are not consistently matched from 2D where indicated. Window count and placement are off: a window in the left bedroom and the rightmost room is missing, and the two windows in the top wall of the 3D model are not present in the 2D plan. Consistent scale overall, no major aspect ratio distortion. Missing two windows (-2 pts). Hallucinated two windows (-0 pts, but noted under hallucination control). Bedroom door in top right corner is hallucinated. Missing door for bathroom and the central open space (-4 pts). Main open area is now a defined room with walls and a door, changing topology.

Some furniture from the 2D is missing in the 3D beside the left bedroom door, and an armchair by the sofa. Furniture placement generally matches plan locations within tolerance. Scale is appropriate. Deductions for missing kitchen appliances and general kitchen counters, and minor missing decorative items."

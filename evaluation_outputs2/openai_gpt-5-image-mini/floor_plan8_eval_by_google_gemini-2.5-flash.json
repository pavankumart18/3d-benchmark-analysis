W/C and Closets are not accurately represented; specifically, the W/C is missing, replaced by a simple corridor leading to the stairs. The 'CLOSET 7668' is also missing. The Kitchen layout is mostly accurate, though the pantry is absent. The Playroom is simplified, with its entrance from the main area being wider than indicated by individual doors. Several walls have significant deviations in position and shape from the 2D plan, especially around the living room and entryway."

The main issue for presentation context is 'ground plane/shadows extending to infinity' as the rendered model appears to be casting a shadow on a surface and not floating."

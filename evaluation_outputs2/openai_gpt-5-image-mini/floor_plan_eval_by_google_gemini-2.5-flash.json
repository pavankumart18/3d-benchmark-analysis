There are 2 windows in the 3D render instead of 3 in the 2D plan, with one being placed incorrectly (in the kitchen instead of the bathroom). The kitchen layout is significantly different. The second bathroom (between Monica's and Rachel's bedrooms) is missing most of its walls and is combined with the original kitchen space."

There is a strange, extended 'ground plane' shadow in the render, violating presentation context rules. The dark neutral background is poorly executed with noticeable reflections/gradients on what appears to be a plane."

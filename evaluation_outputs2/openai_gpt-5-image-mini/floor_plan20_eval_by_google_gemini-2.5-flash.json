Wall geometry has inaccuracies, particularly around the kitchen/maid's room area which is missing. Many doors are either missing or misplaced, and their swing directions do not always match the plan, or are simplified to not show swing. Window count and placement are mostly accurate, but some are missing. Consistent scaling is present, but significant parts of the layout are not."

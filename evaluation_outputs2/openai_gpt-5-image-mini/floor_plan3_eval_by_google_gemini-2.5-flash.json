One of the windows was converted into a door. The size of the staircase is not correctly preserved, leading to a much smaller staircase in the 3D model."

The camera angle is an isometric projection, but it's not a strict 45\u00b0 rotation of the plan view and the model is not perfectly centered, with more empty space on one side."

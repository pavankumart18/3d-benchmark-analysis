        "notes": "Layout topology is mostly preserved. Overall footprint matches, but the living/dining area is disproportionately larger in the 3D model, encroaching on Bedroom-2 and the utility area. Wall positions are generally accurate but some interior walls show slight misalignments or are missing (e.g., small wall segment separating shower in M.Bedroom toilet). Missing windows in Bedroom-1 and Kitchen. Windows in Bedroom-2, Living/Dining, and M.Bedroom are present but their relative positions (height, horizontal placement) are not always precise. The scaling appears consistent, but some areas feel stretched."

Completeness suffers from small missing structural elements like the wall separating the shower in the M.Bedroom toilet. Minor hallucination with an extra wall segment in the L-shaped balcony. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is a critical failure as there is text visible on furniture and potentially other elements (e.g., patterns on floors/walls could be interpreted as annotations if they are not solid colors) which makes the subscore 0. Presentation context is good, with a dark background and the model floating, but minor shadows are present on the base."

Also, specific elements like the fridge in the utility area are missing, and some bathroom fixtures are simplified/different. The scale of the furniture generally appears appropriate."

This is not a critical failure but causes deduction. Lighting is soft ambient with minimal shadows. No dramatic contrasts. Colors are distinguishable. Camera view is a true isometric projection, well-composed, centered, and at an appropriate zoom level."

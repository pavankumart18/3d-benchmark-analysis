The 'Lobby' area is changed in the render, combined with 'Home Office / Maid's Room'. The 'Deck' area is also significantly changed, with a wall added where there was an opening to the living room in the plan, and the internal dimensions are different. The overall footprint shape is mostly maintained, but there are notable discrepancies in internal wall positions."

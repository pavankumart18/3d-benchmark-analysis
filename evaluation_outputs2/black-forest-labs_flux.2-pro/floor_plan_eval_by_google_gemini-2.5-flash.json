        "notes": "1.1 Layout Topology: Overall shape maintained, room count matches, but relative size of master bedroom appears slightly smaller and living room/dining area slightly larger than proportionate. (Deduction: 2 pts) \n1.2 Wall Geometry: Most wall positions are accurate but some internal walls (e.g., between Rachel's bedroom and bathroom) seem slightly thicker, and the wall separating Monica's bedroom from the bathroom is off. The kitchen wall by the closet also slightly differs. (Deduction: 4 pts) \n1.3 Openings - Doors: All doors are present. Placement is generally correct but the swing direction for the closet door near the kitchen is incorrect. The door to Rachel's bathroom opens inward, while the plan shows it opening outward. (Deduction: 2 pts) \n1.4 Openings - Windows: All windows are present and on correct walls. Sizes appear proportional. (Deduction: 1 pt for an overall sense of slight disproportion) \n1.5 Dimensional Scaling: Consistent overall scale, no major aspect ratio distortion. (Deduction: 1 pt for minor proportionality issues mentioned above)"

However, the generated 3D image has no text, measurements, or legends, fulfilling the requirement for the _generated_ output. Scoring based on the generated and not the original. (Deduction: 4 pts for not realizing the instruction meant the *generated* image should not have UI/Annotation elements based on the prompt's language, will adjust scoring mechanism in future iterations) \n2.5 Presentation Context: Dark neutral background. Model appears floating. There is a very subtle shadow but no ground plane extending to infinity."

Render has 4 distinct rooms that do not map directly to the plan, plus an additional entrance area. Dining Room and Living Room are combined in the render. Bathroom layout is significantly different. (0/10) 1.2 Wall Geometry: Wall positions are completely different from the plan. Many walls present in the render are not in the plan, and vice versa. Corner angles are preserved for the square structure but internally inconsistent with the plan. (0/10) 1.3 Openings - Doors: Only 3 doors are clearly visible in the render, compared to 5 in the plan (including the inaccessible entrance door in the plan). Placement is incorrect relative to the plan's room structure. Swing direction for the bathroom door in the plan is outward, but inward in the render. (0/10) 1.4 Openings - Windows: Number of windows does not match. Plan has 4 windows, render has 5. Placement is incorrect due to completely different wall layouts. (0/5) 1.5 Dimensional Scaling: Inapplicable due to fundamental layout differences. (0/5)"

The 3D model shows a full-length wall, but the 2D plan indicates a partial wall opening between Living Room and Bedroom 1 for the stairs. The 'Wash Area' in 2D is a separate, enclosed room, but in 3D it's open, integrated into the hallway leading to the Toilet. Kitchen exterior wall not perfectly aligned with dining room exterior wall, causing a slight offset not present in 2D. Kitchen sink area wall is indented in 3D but straight in 2D. The U-shaped window in the Dining area is represented as two separate windows in the 3D render. The external wall geometry of the living room and stairs area differs between the 2D and 3D. The 2D shows a more complex, stepped outline, while the 3D simplifies it. The overall footprint shape is modified around the stairs area. The main entrance door in 3D has a different opening direction from the 2D plan. The 2D plan shows the kitchen having a slightly different outline with part of the wall extending to the 'Entrance to the House' indicating a separate entrance. In the 3D model, this area appears to be a continuous part of the exterior wall from the kitchen, without a clear separate 'Entrance to the House' section."

The 'Wash Area' and 'Toilet' internal partitions are altered. The 3D model shows a significant amount of shadow on the floor and within the spaces, particularly noticeable in the kitchen and the area between bedroom/toilet. The interior side of the exterior staircase wall appears too high, like a cutaway. The 2D plan shows a distinct 'Entrance to the House' area which is not fully translated in the 3D model, blending into the external kitchen wall. The railing of the stairs has a partial ceiling-like structure above it."

The image has a dark gray background, which is acceptable. The isometric projection is accurate, and the framing is centered. There's a subtle texture on the floor and wall surfaces, particularly noticeable on the grey walls and beige floor, detracting from a pure solid color requirement. The furniture also has a slight texture and gradient. The shadows are a bit too prominent, which deviates from 'minimal shadows'."

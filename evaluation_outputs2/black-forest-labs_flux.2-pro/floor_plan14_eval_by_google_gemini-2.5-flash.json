This results in a completely enclosed room where an open deck should be. The deck adjacent to BED-2 is also present but its railing is not well-defined, and the overall form is simplified. The deck adjacent to TOI-1/BED-1 is also significantly altered in form and enclosed by a solid wall rather than an open railing. Presentation context is poor; there are strong shadows extending to infinity, and a ground plane is present."

Lighting is harsh with strong shadows, not soft ambient. The render is not truly isometric as parallel lines appear to converge slightly, indicating minor perspective distortion, and the rotation is not a pure 45-degree isometric as expected."

Some internal wall proportions, particularly in the bathroom and bedroom on the right side, seem slightly off. One external doorway is converted to a window. Windows are generally present but inaccurately sized and positioned on the walls. The scaling appears consistent, but the overall aspect ratio is slightly compressed compared to the 2D plan, especially in height."

Lighting is soft and ambient with minimal shadows, but there is some depth/shading that leans slightly away from pure flat-shaded. The camera view is a true isometric projection with good framing, though the external floor plane is a distraction."

The pantry from the 2D plan is missing. The small closet next to the W/C is also missing. The front entrance (foyer area) has been significantly altered, removing the original double-door entry and creating a new exterior staircase. The connection between the living room and dining room is enclosed in the 3D model, unlike the open plan shown in the 2D. Windows are largely missing or misplaced compared to the plan."

Hallucination control is poor due to the addition of exterior stairs and significant reshaping of the entryway, as well as enclosing the living/dining space. There is a visible logo or watermark in the upper right. The background is dark and the model is somewhat isolated, but there are some visible ground plane reflections/shadows extending into the background."

There are some subtle material properties that suggest more than just flat coloring, like slight reflections. The lighting is soft ambient, but there are noticeable shadows on the floor and objects, indicating some directional light source. The camera composition appears to be a true isometric projection with a 45\u00b0 rotated plan view, centered and appropriately zoomed. The shadows sometimes extend outside the model's footprint onto the background."

Wall positions have several minor misalignments, particularly around the Utility area and the external walls of the Living/Dining. Some corner angles are not perfectly preserved. Doors are mostly present and on correct walls, but swing directions are not clearly indicated or do not match the 2D plan where discernible. Windows are present and placed correctly, but their proportions are not always accurate. Scaling is generally consistent but some rooms appear squashed or stretched slightly."

Several structural elements from the 2D plan, especially in the Utility and Toilet areas, are either missing or significantly simplified/misrepresented (e.g., washbasin in Utility, toilet cistern in main Bathroom plan). There are some minor hallucinations, such as the extra wall-mounted cabinet in the Bedroom. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is a critical failure as there is text present on the wall in the Living/Dining area. Presentation context fails as there is a strong ground plane with significant shadows, and the model is not fully isolated."

While generally simplified, there is visible smooth shading on some furniture, and textures/gradients are applied to floors (yellow/beige) and walls (grey), which deducts points. Lighting is ambient but there are noticeable, somewhat dramatic shadows, indicating more than minimal shadows. Colors are distinguishable. Camera view is mostly isometric and positioned correctly, but the strong shadows and ground plane detract from the ideal composition."

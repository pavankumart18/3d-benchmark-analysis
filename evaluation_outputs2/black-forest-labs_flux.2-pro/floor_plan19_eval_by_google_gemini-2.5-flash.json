Wall geometry is largely accurate, though some minor wall thickness variations are present where the plan specifies different materials or structures. Doors are mostly well-placed, but some swing directions are not clearly indicated or modeled. Window presence and placement are good. Dimensional scaling appears consistent."

However, there are significant issues with hallucination control, as exterior walls and features extending beyond the primary floor plan are added. UI/annotation cleanliness is a critical failure due to the presence of a text label ('UTILITY'). Presentation context is also failed because of the floor pattern extending to infinity and the shadow casting. The red arrow from the 2D plan is also present, which is a UI element."

Lighting is soft, but shadows are quite prominent. Camera composition includes an isometric projection, proper rotation, and good framing, and appropriate zoom."

        "notes": "Layout topology is largely correct, but there's an extra section of wall near the stairs in the 3D model that significantly alters the 'hallway' zone. The overall footprint is well-maintained. Wall positions have several inaccuracies, particularly around the bathroom and staircase areas where the 3D model introduces an unnecessary wall. Doors are mostly present, but a crucial door to the bathroom/powder room area is missing, and the bedroom door's swing is reversed. Windows are present and correctly placed, though their sizes are not perfectly proportional. Dimensional scaling is generally consistent, but the wall thickness discrepancy and added wall near stairs suggest some scale deviation."

Hallucination control is poor due to the presence of architectural text labels ('Kitchen Living', 'Bedroom') and an unnecessary wall in the hallway. UI/Annotation Cleanliness score is 0 due to the presence of text labels. The presentation context is suboptimal; while the model is isolated and on a dark background, shadows extend beyond the model, and the background is a gradient instead of a solid color."

There are some subtle textures (e.g., on cushions, bedspread) that detract from the 'solid flat colors only' rule. Lighting is soft, but shadows are quite prominent. Colors are distinguishable. The camera composition is an isometric projection with a 45\u00b0 rotated plan view, centered and appropriately zoomed. Shadows extend too far, suggesting a ground plane is rendered, which is a minor deviation. The rendering is not photorealistic but has some material properties beyond simple flat colors."

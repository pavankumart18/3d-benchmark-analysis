Wall positions for the bathroom are altered. Window placements on the front facade are incorrect. The overall footprint maintains the general L-shape, but some external wall alignments are off. Consistent scale factor is not evident in some areas, specifically the size of the kitchen and bathroom compared to the bedroom and living/dining area. Window sizes are not proportional to wall lengths."

The Balcony railing is rendered as a full wall, not a railing. The roof is removed and interior walls are fully visible. The render is free of UI elements. However, the background is not consistently dark and neutral, with some lighter areas, and the model shows a distinct ground plane with shadows that are too strong and extend unnecessarily."

The washing machine from the utility area is moved into the kitchen."

Lighting is ambient but casts noticeable shadows, which are a bit too dramatic for the specified minimal shadows. Colors are distinguishable. The camera view is isometric and generally well-composed, but the ground plane and shadows detract from the isolated presentation requirement."

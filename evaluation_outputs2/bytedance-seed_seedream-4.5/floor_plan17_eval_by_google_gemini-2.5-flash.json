Room adjacency is generally good. Relative room sizes are mostly proportionate.  Many doors are missing or incorrectly placed. Window count is mostly accurate, but some positions are off, and widths are not consistently proportional. Scaling appears mostly uniform but without exact dimensions, it's hard to be precise."

Completeness is slightly impacted by missing a few internal structural walls (e.g., in the toilet area). There's some minor architectural hallucination with the redesign of a few toilet/utility walls. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is 0 due to numerous text labels present in the 3D render. The background is dark and neutral, and the model appears isolated, but there's a visible ground plane and shadows, slightly off 'floating/isolated' criteria."

The view is isometric, but the framing could be better centered and zoomed."

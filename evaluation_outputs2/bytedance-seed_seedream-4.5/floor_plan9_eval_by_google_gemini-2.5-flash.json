Adjacencies are generally preserved with some wall placement issues. Relative room sizes are distorted in some areas, particularly the garage and adjacent rooms. Overall footprint is maintained but with significant deviations in the covered patio areas and the front of the garage. Wall positions are inconsistent, with many walls misaligned. Covered Patio south wall is completely missing. Garage is significantly undersized horizontally and vertically. Doors are mostly present, but swing directions are ignored. Some doors are also missing (e.g., Master Bath toilet, Hall linen closet). Windows are mostly present but placement and proportion are off (e.g. Living room, Nook, Kitchen, Study, Master Bedroom, Master Bath). Scale factor is inconsistent, with objects like the car in the garage appearing disproportionate to the house."

Interior walls are visible where the roof is cut. Several structural elements are missing, such as the two covered patios. The car garage is significantly altered, including its entrance. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is 0 because all text labels from the original plan are present in the 3D render. The background is dark and neutral, but there are shadows and a ground plane visible under the garage area, and extending under the main house, making it not completely floating/isolated."

Furniture placement is often inaccurate (e.g., Living Room sofa, Dining Room table is not the one from the plan). Scale is often inappropriate. Many furniture items present in the 2D plan are missing in the 3D render, such as the dresser/cabinet in the Nook, the large L-shaped couch in the Living Room, the dining table and chairs, and all of the bedroom furniture."

No textures, but some color variation and minor gradients are present (e.g. driveway, car), which is a deviation from solid flat colors. Lighting is ambient but with noticeable areas of brighter light (e.g., emanating unrealistically from windows). Shadows are softer, but still distinct. Colors are distinguishable. The camera view is isometric, but the house is placed in the bottom right corner with significant empty space in the top left, thus not perfectly centered. The zoom level is appropriate."

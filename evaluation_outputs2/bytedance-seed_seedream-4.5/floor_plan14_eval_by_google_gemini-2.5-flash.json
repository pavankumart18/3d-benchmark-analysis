The rendering has a subtle ground plane effect with soft shadows under the structure which slightly deviates from the 'model appears floating/isolated' requirement, but not significantly enough to be a critical error."

This violates the 'no textures (solid flat colors only)' and 'flat shaded surfaces (no smooth shading/subdivision)' requirements. While the overall look is stylized and not photo-realistic, these material properties are present. Lighting also shows some advanced rendering techniques beyond soft ambient light, with discernible light sources especially from the windows and balconies, casting more defined shadows than expected for 'minimal shadows'. The camera composition is good, maintaining a true isometric view."

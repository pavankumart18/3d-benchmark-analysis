The kitchen, utility, master bedroom, and two toilets on the left side of the 3D model do not match the 2D layout. The balcony on the bottom left is completely altered. Wall positions are globally misaligned, especially for the master bedroom and adjacent toilets. Doors are present and largely on correct walls, but swing directions often differ. Window count and placement are mostly consistent in the main living area, but the 3D model introduces windows in the lower left bedroom (Master Bedroom in 2D) where none exist in the 2D plan. The 3D model contains an extra 'storage' room where 'T.P. TOILET' should be, which also has a door leading outside, completely altering the layout. The 'MBEDROOM' in 2D becomes 'BEDROOM 3' with different dimensions and window placement in 3D. The 'BEDROOM-1' in 2D becomes 'BEDROOM 4', also with different layouts and window placements. The 'BEDROOM-2' in 2D becomes 'BEDROOM 2' but the dimensions do not match the 2D plan and the adjacent toilet layout is altered dramatically."

For example, the kitchen layout in 3D is completely different from the 2D plan, and the 'MBEDROOM' in 2D has a different bed placement and size compared to 'BEDROOM 3' in 3D. The 'BEDROOM-1' in 2D has a bed, but 'BEDROOM 4' in 3D has a sofa sleeper or daybed."

The 'photorealistic materials' and 'textures' aspects significantly deduct points here."

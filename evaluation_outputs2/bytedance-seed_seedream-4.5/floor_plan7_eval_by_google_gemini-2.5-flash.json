The most significant is the complete remapping of the 'Bedroom 1' from the 2D plan into 'Living Room 1' in the 3D render. The original 'Living Room' and 'Entrance to the House' from the 2D plan are also completely re-imagined. The bathroom layout is significantly altered, and the 'Wash Area' is present but poorly integrated. Windows are present but counts do not match exactly. Stairwell is not maintained as per the 2D plan."

UI includes room labels on the floor, resulting in an automatic 0 for this sub-category. Presentation context is also not fully met due to the ground color/shadows."

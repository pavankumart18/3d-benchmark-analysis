The 'Lobby' area's internal wall is missing. The 'Home Office / Maid's Room' external wall is incorrectly extended, making the room larger than depicted in the 2D plan. Balcony 1 and Balcony 2 on the right side appear to be slightly smaller than the 2D plan. The area labeled 'UTILITY' is missing its door, making it an open L-shaped space connected to the kitchen. Toilet-2 and Toilet-3 interiors are accurately mapped."

Balconies on the render are smaller and don't match the 2D plan in shape or size. There are no UI elements, but the overall completeness suffers due to structural alterations. The presence of lights that cast shadows detracts from the 'soft ambient lighting' requirement and causes some areas to be too dark."

Toilet-1, Toilet-2, and Toilet-3 fixtures are present and correctly mapped. Kitchen fixtures are present, but the layout is slightly different, and the island is missing. The side table and lamp in Bedroom-1 and Bedroom-2 are approximated but overall accuracy is low."

        "notes": "The geometry style is low-poly and uses flat-shaded surfaces with solid colors, aligning with the requirements. However, the lighting setup is problematic. There are distinct light sources within the rooms (appearing like recessed lights) that cast strong shadows and create noticeable bright spots and dark areas, violating the 'soft ambient lighting with minimal shadows' rule. There is also evident ambient occlusion, which goes against the 'flat shaded surfaces' rule if interpreted strictly as no advanced shading techniques. The camera angle is an isometric projection, and the composition is well-centered."

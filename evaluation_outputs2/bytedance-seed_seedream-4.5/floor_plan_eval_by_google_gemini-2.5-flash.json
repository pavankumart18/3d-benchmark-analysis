Relative room sizes are acceptable for major rooms, but the bathroom next to Rachel's bedroom and the closet room next to the kitchen are significantly distorted. The overall footprint shape is maintained. Wall positions have some deviations, particularly the entire left side of the apartment (Rachel's Bedroom and bathroom wall) is shifted inwards relative to the plan. One internal wall element near the kitchen is missing in the 3D render. Door swings are not consistently followed or are simplified. Window sizes and exact positions are off in several instances."

There is some missing structural completeness regarding a small internal wall segment near the kitchen/closet area. Hallucination control is poor, with an added feature for 'CHANDLER & JOEY'S APARTMENT' and other text. UI/Annotation Cleanliness is a critical failure, as multiple text labels and external information are present. Presentation context fails due to the external annotations/text and the background not being completely neutral due to text."

However, there are significant discrepancies in placement and scale. For instance, the furniture in Rachel's bedroom is reversed relative to the plan. The kitchen counter layout is altered, and a full-size refrigerator is added next to the front door, which is not on the plan. The bathroom fixture layouts are simplified and don't match the plan precisely. The TV unit in the living room is missing, and the coffee table is different. The dining table is in the correct place but the chairs are laid out differently. The couch in the living room is not matching the placement and orientation of the 2D plan. The sofa and armchair in Monica's bedroom are missing."

        "notes": "The geometry style is not low-poly or flat-shaded as specified. Surfaces clearly show smooth shading/subdivision, and specific materials/textures are used for floors, walls, and furniture (wood, tiles, fabric). This deviates significantly from the flat-shaded, no-texture requirement. Lighting has shadows and appears somewhat soft but definitely not 'minimal shadows'. Colors are distinguishable. The camera is not a true isometric projection (perspective distortion is visible, parallel lines appear to converge slightly). The view is from a 45-degree rotated plan viewpoint, centered, and all rooms are visible. The colors used are a significant deviation from the expectation of solid flat colors."

Window and door placement is mostly correct for existing elements, but some are missing. Relative room sizes are distorted due to missing sections/incorrect splitting. The 3D render also has text labels on the floor, which were not present in the 2D plan and is a major violation of rendering constraints."

Lighting is somewhat soft ambient but includes noticeable shadows, which are not minimal. The camera composition is problematic; while it is an isometric projection, the model is not properly centered, and more importantly, the floor of the model contains text labels, which are not allowed. The implied external environment and shadows extending beyond the model also detract from the desired presentation context."

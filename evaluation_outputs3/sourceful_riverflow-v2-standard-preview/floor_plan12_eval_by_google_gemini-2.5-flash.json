Room proportions are generally maintained, but there are some discrepancies, particularly in the 'Activity' area where the L-shaped bench is rendered as a straight, shorter wall. Major wall positions are accurate. Doors are present and correctly placed. Windows are also mostly correct, although some appear to be solid blocks rather than openings facilitating light, especially in 'Bed 2' and 'Bed 3'. The window next to the stairs in the 'Activity' area is a solid wall in 3D."

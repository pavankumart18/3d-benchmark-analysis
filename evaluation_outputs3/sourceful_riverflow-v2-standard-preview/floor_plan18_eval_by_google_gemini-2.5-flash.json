The viewing angle is an excellent angled/isometric view, providing good visibility into the interior. The roof/ceiling is cleanly removed, exposing all interior spaces. Minimal perspective distortion. Scored 5/5 for cutaway treatment, 15/15 for dimensional transformation, and 10/10 for viewing angle."

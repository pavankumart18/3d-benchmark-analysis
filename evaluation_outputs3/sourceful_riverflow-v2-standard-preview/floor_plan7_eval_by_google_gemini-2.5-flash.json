Internal partitions are correctly placed. All major doors and windows are present and on correct walls, with good proportional sizing and orientation. Slight discrepancy in the 'Entrance to the House' area where the outdoor steps/landing are not fully represented in 3D, and the interior steps for 'UP' are present and accurately depicted."

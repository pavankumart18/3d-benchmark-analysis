Doors are present and correctly placed. Window presence is less clear in the 3D render due to the cutaway, but inferred to be largely accurate."

Aesthetic coherence is very good with consistent material usage and no major rendering artifacts. The background is clean and aids presentation. Text labels from the original floor plan are not reproduced in the 3D, which is good."

The view is angled and provides an elevated perspective. The roof is cleanly removed and interior spaces are fully visible. There are minor imperfections in some corner geometries, slightly detracting from overall perfection."

Major wall positions are aligned with the 2D plan, and wall lengths are proportional. Internal partitions are correctly placed.

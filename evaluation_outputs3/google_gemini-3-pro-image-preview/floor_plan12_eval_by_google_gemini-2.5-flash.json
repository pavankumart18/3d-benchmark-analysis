Proper 3D wall corner geometry is mostly present, but some corners, especially near the 'ACTIVITY' area, appear slightly rounded or less defined than expected for 'proper' 3D geometry. The viewing angle is appropriate, and the interior is fully visible from an elevated perspective. The roof/ceiling is cleanly removed, and interior spaces are fully visible, with clean geometry, although there's a slight discrepancy in the 'balcony' area where the 2D shows a balustrade that isn't clearly represented as a distinct element in 3D but rather as a low wall."

Most major wall positions align, but the 'BALCONY' balustrade is depicted as a solid wall, and the 'RECESS' area in the 2D plan is represented differently in the 3D, lacking the depth implied by the 2D. Wall lengths are mostly proportional. Internal partitions are correctly placed. Doors are present and on correct walls, but some doors, particularly the one for 'WC', are represented as openings rather than distinct door elements. Windows are not clearly represented as windows, only as openings, or are missing from walls where they might be implied by light from interior furnishing in the 2D (like in 'BED 2')."

The 'PLAYROOM' in the 2D plan is represented as a room with a bed, but the shape and entrance are altered. The 'FOYER' area also seems to have a different wall structure and door placement. The pantry is missing. The 'W/C' seems to be missing an interior wall to separate the toilet/sink area from the main space, forming one larger bathroom which isn't accurate to the 2D plan. The exterior wall structure around the 'DINING ROOM' and 'LIVING ROOM' is simplified/inaccurate in some parts. Windows were difficult to verify implicitly from the 2D plan, but there are no obvious window cutouts in the 3D model, implying they are either missing or were not converted from the 2D plan. However, the plan mostly shows external dimensions, not window locations."

Relative room proportions are largely preserved, though the 3D model seems to have slightly altered the overall footprint in certain areas (e.g., the rightmost side with the small exterior walls, and the bottom left exterior wall). Wall positions align well, but the small external structures on the left and right are altered. Internal partitions are mostly in place. Doors are present and correctly placed, but some windows are missing (e.g., in the bathroom/toilet areas, and the large windows on the left and right exterior walls). Opening sizes are generally proportional."

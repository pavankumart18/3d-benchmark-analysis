The angled view is good, providing an elevated perspective, though there is a very slight perspective distortion making some rooms appear stretched. The cutaway treatment is clean, making interiors fully visible."

Wall geometry aligns very well with the 2D plan, with accurate placement and length. Doors are mostly correct, but windows are generally missing or simplified to wall openings, which affects the score slightly. The study opening is also distorted from the original."

The aesthetic coherence is high, with consistent material usage, no major rendering artifacts, and a clean background."

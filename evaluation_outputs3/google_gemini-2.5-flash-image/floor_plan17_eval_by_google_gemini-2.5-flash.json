Most major wall positions align, with wall lengths proportional. Internal partitions are correctly placed. Doors are present and on correct walls. Windows are present, but their representation and exact placement are simplified; some might be missing or misplaced subtly compared to the original, but the major functional elements are there. Overall very good."

However, the background is a plain gray and the text labels from the 2D plan are overlaid on the 3D render, detracting from the 'clean background' aspect and aesthetic coherence. This results in a deduction for aesthetic coherence (e.g., 2/6 instead of 6/6 for this aspect)."

Viewing angle is good. Interior is visible but lacks strong elevation. Minimal distortion. Roof is cleanly removed, exposing interiors."

Major wall positions align well. Wall lengths are proportional. Internal partitions are correctly placed. Doors are present and in correct locations. Windows are represented, mostly on correct walls, but some window details and orientations are simplified."

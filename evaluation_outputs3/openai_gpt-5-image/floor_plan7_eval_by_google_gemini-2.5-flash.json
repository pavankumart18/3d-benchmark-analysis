Internal partitions are mostly correct. However, the exact placement and sometimes presence of doors and windows are not fully accurate. Specifically, the 'Entrance to the House' door is present, but opens differently. The door leading from 'Wash Area' to 'Toilet' is missing. The 'Bedroom 1' has windows, but their exact count and position differ. There are numerous missing door openings in the 3D model (e.g., Dining to Kitchen, Kitchen to Entrance, Bedroom to Wash Area)."

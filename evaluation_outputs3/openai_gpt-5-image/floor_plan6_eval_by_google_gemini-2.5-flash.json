Major wall positions align well; however, the partition between the bathroom and the stairs is simplified from the 2D, which showed a deeper alcove. Doors are present and correctly placed. Windows are also present; however, the 2D plan indicates three windows on the bottom wall in the kitchen/living area, but the 3D render only shows one larger window. Also, windows are missing on the left side wall of the kitchen/living area, which are shown as small squares in the 2D plan. The 2D plan shows one window on the right wall of the bedroom, but the 3D render shows two on that wall. The 2D plan also shows small windows on the exterior wall of the bathroom, which are missing in the 3D."

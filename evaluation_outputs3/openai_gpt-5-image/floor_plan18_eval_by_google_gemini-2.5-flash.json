Major wall positions align well. Wall lengths are proportionally reasonable. Internal partitions are mostly correct, but the utility/toilet wall segment is significantly altered from the 2D plan, creating an open shower area which wasn't clearly indicated. The balcony wall on the left side is simplified to an open railing structure which doesn't fully match the 2D plan's wall and window arrangement. Doors are present and on correct walls, but the door leading to the utility in the 2D plan is missing in the 3D render. Windows are present and on correct walls (bedroom and utility/toilet area). Openings are proportionally sized and oriented, with the exception of the missing utility door. The balcony area's geometry is also simplified."

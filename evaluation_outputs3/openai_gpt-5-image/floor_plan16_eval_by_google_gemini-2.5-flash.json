Internal partitions are correctly placed. Doors are present, but their swing direction is not clear, and the 2D shows a door for the toilet and bedroom, which are absent or represented as open doorways in 3D. Windows are present on correct walls, but their size and placement for Bedroom 1 and Balcony are slightly different. The toilet has no window in 3D, but it is implied in 2D."

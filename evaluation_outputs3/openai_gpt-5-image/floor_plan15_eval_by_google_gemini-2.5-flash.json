Major wall positions mostly align, but some internal partitions are simplified or slightly altered (e.g., the smaller toilets). Doors are present on correct walls, but the window count and placement are not perfectly accurate; some windows are missing or shifted. Balconies from the 2D plan are also not fully represented as balconies in the 3D model, affecting the overall geometric layout."

Minor issue with the covered patios not being as fully 3D as the interior."

The 'Covered Patio' at the bottom left is also significantly changed. Most major wall positions align, and internal partitions are generally correct, but the overall outer perimeter is slightly simplified in places and the curved wall in the master bath is less pronounced. Doors are generally present and on correct walls, but specific orientations or double doors are not always accurately depicted. Windows are generally present but details are simplified."

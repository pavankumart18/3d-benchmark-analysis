Proper 3D wall corner geometry is mostly good, but some internal corners (like near the stairs or utility room) are a bit blocky.

The geometry is mostly clean, only minor blockiness in some areas."

Doors are present on most correct walls, but some are missing (e.g., to WC, utility room). Windows are present but some are simplified, and their proportional sizing isn't always accurate."

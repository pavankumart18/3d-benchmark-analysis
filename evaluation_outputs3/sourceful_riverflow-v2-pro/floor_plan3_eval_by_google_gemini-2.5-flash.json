Major wall positions align well. Doors are present and on correct walls. Windows are present but only one on the large external wall, whereas the 2D shows three. The 'ENTRANCE' area is slightly simplified, removing the exterior steps shown in the 2D plan. The 2D plan's text labels for Kitchen and Dining Room are a single continuous space in the 3D, and the bathroom is not explicitly separated from the living area by a full wall, though its volume is clear. The 'LIVING ROOM' area combines with 'DINING ROOM' and 'ENTRANCE' forming a large open space in the 3D model, which is partially consistent with the 2D layout."

The 'Wide Passages' are also not explicitly delineated as they are in the 2D. Major wall positions show some discrepancies, especially around the balconies/utility area. Wall lengths are generally proportional, but the entrance area and the utility/toilet area in the 3D deviate significantly from the 2D plan. Doors are present but some door swings are missing or incorrectly oriented. Windows are present, but their placement and number do not perfectly match the 2D, and their proportional sizing isn't consistent with the 2D."

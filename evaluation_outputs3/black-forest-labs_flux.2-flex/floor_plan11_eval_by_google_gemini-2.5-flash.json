Interior volume is well perceivable. 3D wall corner geometry is mostly good, though some stair areas are simplified. The viewing angle is excellent. Interior is visible from an elevated perspective. Minimal perspective distortion. Roof is cleanly removed, and interior spaces are fully visible. Geometry is clean with no broken sections."

The number of rooms might seem slightly off due to how the 'Central Hall' is defined in 2D vs. the open layout in 3D, but major adjacencies are preserved. Relative room proportions are largely preserved. Major wall positions align well. Wall lengths are proportional. Internal partitions are mostly correct, though the 'Alcove' area and some storage next to the stairs are simplified. Doors are present and on correct walls. Windows are present and generally on correct walls, though some window types differ (e.g., the large window seat area). Openings are proportionally sized and oriented."

Relative room proportions are well-preserved. Major room identities match. Major wall positions align perfectly with 2D plan and wall lengths are proportional. Internal partitions are mostly correctly placed. The toilet room and wash area are accurately reproduced. Doors are present and on correct walls, opening directions match in most cases. Windows are present and on correct walls and are proportionally sized and oriented."

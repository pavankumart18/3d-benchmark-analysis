There's a slight mismatch in the 'Lounge' and 'Dining' area as it appears as one large space in 3D. Major wall positions align well. Wall lengths are proportional. Internal partitions are mostly correct, though the 'L'dry' area in the floor plan appears slightly different in geometry in the 3D model. Doors are present and on correct walls. Windows are present on correct walls and are proportionally sized, though the 3D model adds a window in the lounge area that isn't explicitly shown on the 2D plan, and the 'Balcony' is not clearly defined in the 3D from the 2D layout. The garage is accurately represented."

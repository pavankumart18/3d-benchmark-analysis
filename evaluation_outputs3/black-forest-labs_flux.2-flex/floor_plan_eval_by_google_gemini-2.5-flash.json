Wall geometry is very accurate with correct positioning and proportional lengths. Most internal partitions are correct, though one small partition in Rachel's bedroom seems slightly altered. Doors are present and correctly placed on walls, but some windows, especially in the living room, appear simplified or omitted where significant in the 2D."

Lighting is good, ensuring the interior is clearly visible and does not obscure any geometry. Aesthetic coherence is strong with consistent material usage and no major rendering artifacts. The background is clean and aids presentation, though the original 2D plan's text labels are not carried over to the 3D, which is good for presentation but doesn't affect structural clarity."

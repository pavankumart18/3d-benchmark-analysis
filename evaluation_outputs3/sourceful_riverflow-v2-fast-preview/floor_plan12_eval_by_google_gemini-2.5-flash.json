However, the 'Activity' room is reconfigured into a living area, and its associated '13C HIGH CAPPED WALL' is missing. The 'Recess' area is also omitted. Staircase in the 2D plan is present in the 3D, but its form is simplified. Balcony is present, but missing the 'Wall to 21c AFL' and 'Balustrade' details. Major wall positions align well, and lengths are generally proportional. Some internal partitions are slightly altered (e.g., WC/Bath area). Doors and windows are mostly present on correct walls, but some window placements and sizes deviate slightly, and the bi-fold door to the balcony from the 2D is rendered as a sliding glass door."

The two bedrooms on the left side have been combined into one larger room in 3D. The closet on the far left side of the 2D plan is missing in 3D. The closet next to the bathroom in the 2D plan is also missing. Wall positions are mostly aligned, but the length of the wall between the living room and the combined bedroom is shorter in 3D. Most doors are present and correctly placed, but the door for the combined left bedroom is missing, and a door has been added for the bathroom that wasn't explicitly shown as a swing door in the 2D plan (although an opening was implied). Windows were not prominently featured in the 2D plan but are present in the 3D model, adding realism but not directly verifiable. The layout fidelity is good but has significant alterations in room count and wall geometry."

Furniture placement is generally in the correct rooms, and their scale is reasonable. However, due to the combination of the two left bedrooms into one, the furniture arrangement within that space deviates from the original plan. The 'office' area furniture is well represented, and the living room and dining room furniture are accurate."

Lighting is good, ensuring the interior is clearly visible without obscuring geometry. Aesthetic coherence is high with consistent material usage (wood floors, white walls, brown furniture accents).

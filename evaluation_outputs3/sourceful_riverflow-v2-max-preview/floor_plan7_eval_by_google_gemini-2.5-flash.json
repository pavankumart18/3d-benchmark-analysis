Internal partitions are mostly correct, though the 'Wash Area' feels slightly truncated/altered. Doors are present and on correct walls, but a few entrances like the 'Entrance to the House' and the 'Toilet' door are missing. Windows are present on correct walls and appear proportionally sized. There are two windows visible in the 3D render for the dining area, but only one is explicitly drawn in the 2D plan."
